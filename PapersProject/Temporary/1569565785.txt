Abstract—In a typical receiver, symbol synchronization must
be established before symbol demodulation. This paper discusses
synchronization for an isolated symbol from a ﬁlter-bank type
multicarrier system. It is shown that accurate symbol timing
for a single multicarrier symbol can be obtained using forwardonly processing. The proposed receiver computes continuoustime symbol likelihoods along with a timing metric and its
time derivative. The timing metric shows a sharp concentration
that is used to produce a trigger to sample the matched ﬁlter
outputs. The paper proposes baseband processing using message
passing algorithms derived from factor graphs. Suitable system
parameters for which near-optimum synchronization is obtained
are identiﬁed using computer simulations.

Demodulation (i.e., computation of symbol likelihoods L) and
synchronization as a byproduct of matched ﬁltering.

The paper is structured as follows. The system setup is introduced in Sec. II. Sec. III provides an overview of likelihood
ﬁlters [3] based on linear Gaussian state-space models, message passing on Forney-style factor graphs, and puts together
various ideas – in particular, localized models for pulses using
glue factors – to deﬁne a framework for receiver processing.
Synchronization and detection with forward processing are
elaborated in Sec. IV and performance results are provided for
different combinations of system parameters in Sec. V. The
paper is concluded in Sec. VI. The description of the likelihood
computations in Sec. III will assume some familiarity with
Forney-style factor graphs as in [4].

I. I NTRODUCTION
In a typical receiver, symbol synchronization must be established before symbol demodulation, which, in turn, must
precede decoding. Synchronization is particularly challenging
when isolated packets are transmitted at times unknown to
the receiver. The established approaches in this case can be
classiﬁed into two groups. In the ﬁrst approach, the data is preceded by a preamble that enables the receiver to synchronize
before demodulation. In the second approach, the whole block
is ﬁrst sampled asynchronously and digitally stored, and then
processed to ﬁgure out the symbol boundaries. Neither of these
approaches is entirely satisfactory: the ﬁrst approach wastes
transmission energy for the preamble, whereas the second
approach requires much digital processing.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to this problem.
For a suitably deﬁned multicarrier symbol format, we show
that symbol synchronization (for an isolated symbol that
arrives at an unknown time) can be obtained as a by-product
of matched ﬁltering. The receiver in the proposed system has
the general structure shown in Fig. 1: a time-invariant “ﬁlter”
produces, ﬁrst, a continuous-time likelihood vector L(t) and
simultaneously, a timing signal LT 0 (t) and its derivative, from
which a trigger signal is generated to sample the likelihood
signal L(t) at an optimal moment. The “ﬁlter” may be either
a continuous-time analog circuit or a discrete-time digital
processing unit with a free-running clock; the notation that
we will use assumes the latter, but the proposed system is
perfectly suitable for implementation in the former mode.
Unlike OFDM, the proposed approach does not use a cyclic
preﬁx, and the symbol does not need to arrive within a ﬁxed
time window. For other approaches to the synchronization of
multicarrier symbols see, e.g., [1] [2].

II. S YSTEM S ETUP
Fig. 2 shows the system set up. The transmitter modulates
an encoded block, (b1 , . . . , bM ) ∈ {+1, −1}M , of M bits, on
to binary antipodal pulses. The transmit signal is,

φ[j] =

where αm , m = 1, . . . , M are real and |αm | are known
amplitudes, bm αm > 0, φCB [j] is a complex baseband pulse,
and the elementary pulses are located in adjacent frequency
bands with Ωm = (m−1)Ω0 . We assume orthogonality among
the elementary pulses. We consider baseband processing,
assuming perfect carrier recovery. The receiver sees a noisy
version of the delayed signal: yj = φ[j − ν0 ] + zj , where zj
are i.i.d, zero mean Gaussian random variables with variance
σ 2 and ν0 is the delay unknown to the receiver. The received
signal is passed through a bank of ﬁlters whose outputs are
used to compute two statistics. At the outputs denoted as
A , time-varying log-likelihood ratios for the symbols are
produced. From the outputs denoted as B , the overall signalto-noise log-likelihood ratio is computed which is used to
detect the packet, and to provide a trigger to sample the symbol
likelihoods. It is well known that the accuracy of pulse position

estimation improves with the number of dimensions [5]. When
M is sufﬁciently large, the likelihood for the received signal
exhibits a sharp concentration around the ideal sampling time
ν0 . This phenomenon is fundamental to the scheme and is
used to sample the bits on the ﬂy as the signal arrives and
provide soft outputs (ˆ 1 , . . . , αM ) to a decoder.

III. L IKELIHOOD C OMPUTATION WITH FACTOR G RAPHS
We are interested in computing the likelihood for a statespace model using the Forney style factor graph shown in
Fig. 3 with observations y = (y1 , . . . , yn ), and hidden state
sequence X = (X1 , . . . , Xn ). While the following discussion
applies to general state-space models, we restrict ourselves to
autonomous (i.e., without input) linear models and Gaussian
noise with scalar observations: Xk = AXk−1 , Sk = CXk ,
Yk = Sk + Zk , Zk ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), where A,B, and C are
matrices of suitable dimensions (our notation closely follows
[4]). The graph imposes a constraint on the state vector at
time n using a glue factor [3] labeled g. For example, for
a pure sinusoid model, by choosing g(xn ) ∝ δ( xn − 1),
the factor graph effectively models a subclass of sinusoids
on the unit circle. By placing the glue factor always at the
current time instance, n, we obtain a time-varying hypothesis,
denoted as H(n, g). The graph represents the joint density
p(y, X|H(n, g)). Using sum-product message passing, the
likelihood of the observations under the hypothesis H(n, g)
can be obtained as,

A. Likelihood Filters from Localized Models
Gaussian message passing requires computation of the mean

vector, − Xn , and the covariance matrix, V Xn . By modifying
m
the message computations as shown in Fig. 4 for every edge
Xk , we introduce a “forgetting” with 0 < γ < 1. The
update rule for the covariance matrix in this case typically
−
→
has a steady state solution, V∞ = limn→∞ V Xn . By using
V∞ , and by taking the lower limit of summation to X−∞
→
in (2), the message updates for − Xn can be performed in
m
the form of a stable ﬁlter. This has the effect of localizing
the model to the immediate past with an exponential window,
and is controlled by γ. From the likelihood ﬁlter, the two key

trajectory. In this case, we obtain the likelihood for the known
signal hypothesis. Message passing with this choice leads to
many useful properties that enable us to derive algorithms with
forward processing as highlighted below.
a) The known signal likelihood can be written as
−
→
p(y|H(n, g)) = p(y|H(n)) f Xn (xn = θ). By choosing
different parameters θ1 and θ2 , likelihoods for different
hypotheses, such as in a binary signaling scheme, can
be obtained simultaneously using the same model.
b) The noise only hypothesis can be obtained with θ = 0,
as this implies an all zero solution for the state sequence.
c) In some problems, the previous two results lead to likelihood ratio computations using only forward messages
because the unconstrained likelihood p(y|H(n)) cancels
out. For example, the likelihood ratio between signal and
−
→
−
→
noise hypotheses is f Xn (xn = θ)/ f Xn (xn = 0), that
−
→
between two known signal hypotheses is f Xn (xn =
−
→
θ1 )/ f Xn (xn = θ2 ), and so on.
d) ML parameter estimation can now be restated using (2)
−
→
as θML = argmaxθ f Xn (θ).
e) For a linear Gaussian model, the known signal-to-noise
log-likelihood ratio is related to the inner product as (see
[6] for details),

where φ is the underlying known signal modeled by
some glue factor parameter θ. It is important to note that,
for glue factor at time n, the delay, κ, can be controlled
by a suitable choice of θ. As we are going to show,
this can be used to delay the computations to the end
of a signal (a time-limited pulse in our case) until all
energy has been received. We obtain this using forward
computations and do not require the signal to be causal.
The description so far assumed a ﬁnite observation window.
To obtain algorithms in a truly forward processing style, we
introduce some approximations.

pulses of practical interest, viz. a root-raised cosine Nyquist
pulse or a Gaussian pulse, are well approximated with L = 5.
This decomposition can be written using a separate state-space
model for each sinusoid: at time k, we have Xℓ,k = Aℓ Xℓ,k−1 ,
L
Sk = ℓ=1 Cℓ Xℓ,k . This leads to a loopy factor graph (due
to the sum term). An approximation to message passing is to
avoid the message iterations around the sum term (the details
are omitted here). In other words, each model assumes the
observations yk = Cℓ Xℓ,k + Zk (instead of yk = Sk + Zk )
by ignoring the contribution from the other models. This
approximation does not lead to substantial performance loss.
When the pulse decomposition is combined with localized
models, we obtain a bank of ﬁlters from which time-varying
likelihoods can be computed. For a single pulse, LLR for a
known signal-to-noise hypothesis can be written as,

when the data is unknown (non-data aided synchronization) is
equivalent to identifying the pulse position when the pulse
parameters are unknown. For convenience we assume that
the transmit pulse ends at time 0 and a noisy version is
received with an unknown delay ν0 . The maximum likelihood
estimate of the pulse position, νML , can be obtained from the
log-likelihood ratio of the total transmit pulse versus noise
hypothesis, LT 0 [ν], with νML = argmaxν LT 0 [ν], and

αℓ cos( Ω2J + ψℓ ), αℓ sin( Ω2J + ψℓ ) . The resulting LLR is

The optimum sampling time is at J , where the models match

When the pulses are used in binary antipodal signaling as

where ρm
(θm,1 , . . . , θm,L ) is the parameter vector for
the hypothesis bm = +1 and the maximization is over
{+ρm , −ρm }. The LLRs Lm0 [ν, ρm ] for individual pulses are
computed by adapting (4) to each model. Sampling the bit
LLRs at νML does not necessarily result in a well performing
system unless the ML estimate is very good. In the following,
we examine this from two angles. First, we examine how
νML depends on M and the total pulse energy, ET . Second,
we consider whether a reliable detection using a thresholding
algorithm (for forward processing) is feasible. Throughout this
section, we consider RRC pulses located in adjacent frequency
bands as in (1).

A. Dependency of νML on M and SNR

where the indices m = 1, . . . , M and ℓ = 1, . . . , L refer to
the ℓ-th state-space model for the m-th transmit pulse, φm .
Parameters θm,ℓ correspond to the bit hypothesis bm = +1.
When the message passing approximation is combined with
localized models, the uncoded BER for binary antipodal
signaling (with perfect symbol timing) for a single RRC pulse
is about 0.2dB worse compared to the theoretical limit. For
the multicarrier system in (1), the uncoded BER suffers a
further loss of about 0.3 to 0.5dB. This is due to the loss of
orthogonality of the pulses arising out of the approximations.

We examine how the ML timing estimation error, νǫ
νML − ν0 , depends on M and the total SNR ET /N0 . ET refers
to the energy of the transmitted pulse, φ; as M increases, the
energy per bit, Eb , of the individual pulses is proportionally
decreased to keep ET normalized to unity to enable a fair
comparison of the contribution due to M . Fig. 6 shows the
average squared timing error (ASE) when the pulse parameters
are fully known (i.e., the maxρm in (6) is replaced with
known values of ρm ). The plots (dot-dashed lines) show an
improvement in ASE when M is increased. Fig. 6 also shows
(solid lines) the ASE for the unknown parameter case, which is
our interest. The gain with M is not very pronounced at low
SNRs. However, for a given choice of Eb (M ), increasing
M (Eb ) leads to an increase of pulse energy ET , helping to
reduce the ASE within some required range. Secondly, the

time-varying LLR, LT 0 [ν] shows a sharp concentration around
ν0 for M > 64 as depicted in Fig. 7. These two properties
can be used to achieve timing synchronization.
We would like to exploit the concentration depicted in
Fig. 7 by sampling the bit-wise LLRs when LT 0 [ν] crosses
a threshold Lthr . This is shown in Fig. 8. If the threshold is
low, shown as Lthr1 , an early detection occurs, resulting in the
packet being dropped eventually by the receiver. The threshold
can be raised, say, to Lthr2 to detect very close to νML , but this
would increase the probability of missed detection. A feasible
choice depends on the statistics of the LLR a little away from
the peak, at LT 0 [νML − ǫ], and close to the peak, at LT 0 [νML ].
We introduce the term “false detection” in this context:

The above criterion is sufﬁcient because, LT 0 [νML ] ≥

which meets (7) and (8). This implies in general a further
increase in ET via either M , or Eb , or both compared to the
operating points given in Table I.

C. Choice of System Parameters
The system parameters M , Eb , and the receiver threshold
Lthr can be obtained as outlined below. As timing error affects
sampling of the pulses placed higher up on the spectrum, we
allow up to a certain phase error, θmax , in the state space
model corresponding to the highest frequency, Ωmax :
|νML − ν0 | ≤ ∆νmax , where ∆νmax = θmax /Ωmax , (7)
When M is large, the ML timing estimation error ∆ν = νML −
ν0 is nearly Gaussian. As an example, by choosing, ∆νmax >
4σ∆ν , the probability of false detection (due to the timing
error event E1 ) is upper bounded as, Pr{∆ν > ∆νmax } <
Pr{∆ν > 4σ∆ν } = 3.167 × 10−5 . ∆νmax depends on M via
Ωmax . Table I shows design parameters for θmax = 2 degrees,
and a minimum value of Eb /N0 that meets the criterion (7).
When M is large, LT 0 [νML ] also tends to be nearly Gaussian. Given a probability of missed detection, pmd , we can
choose Lthr such that
Pr{LT 0 [νML ] < Lthr } < pmd .

False detects dominate the system performance and the false
alarm condition (detecting a signal when none is present) is
less important in this system. Two types of events contribute to
false detects. Event E1 is caused by the ML timing estimation
error, |νML − ν0 | > ∆νmax . This error can be reduced only
by increasing either M or Eb or both. Event E2 is the LLR
in the region away from the peak crossing the threshold as
shown in Fig. 8. Another error condition is missed detections
arising from LT 0 [νML ] falling below the threshold. A suitable
operating point meets a given set of criteria for the timing
error, and probabilities for false and missed detection.

Table II shows the performance for different values of M
and Eb /N0 . Simulations were performed on 10, 000 samples
for each set (except 1000 samples for M = 1024) The
table shows the percentage of false detects, ηfd , and the
percentage of missed detects, ηmd , for each case. For ηfd ,
false detects from both events (E1 and E2 ) are accounted
for. The threshold and offset are manually ﬁxed for each set
of system parameters. The algorithm “THR” shows a high
number of false detects, although ηmd reduces with either
M or Eb /N0 . This method has a higher sensitivity to the
choice of the offset νoff because the width of the spike gets
narrower as M increases. Secondly, the threshold crossing
times have a jitter. These two factors make the detection time,
νd , fall outside the allowed range more often, leading to a
higher ηfd . These errors are noticeable at higher values of
Eb /N0 in Table II. Although improvements may be obtained
by an accurate estimation of νoff , the algorithm “THRNPEAK”
offers a better alternative. The algorithm “THRNPEAK” is less
sensitive to the choice of the ﬁrst threshold and performs closer
to “ML” as M or Eb /N0 are increased. For each choice of
Eb /N0 there exists a value of M above which the detection
performance shows considerable improvement. Alternately, at
higher values of M , even though the tolerance in (7) is tighter,
a given detection performance is achieved at lower value of
Eb /N0 . The uncoded BER performance due to timing errors
incurs no signiﬁcant loss in this scheme and stays within the
previously mentioned limits. Another observation (not shown
in the table) is, the false detects are mostly dominated by the
event E2 discussed before; otherwise νd is equal to the true
value ν0 with high probability.

VI. C ONCLUSION
We have shown that near-optimal synchronization of isolated multicarrier symbols can be obtained as a by-product
of matched ﬁltering. The method does not require the subcarriers to be down-converted before sampling; however, if this
is done, then the sensitivity to timing errors would signiﬁcantly
reduce and operation at even lower SNRs may be feasible.
Performance improvements are also possible by modulating
some sub-carriers with known data. The approach of using
glue factor constraints may be extended with some changes
to non-binary signaling schemes as well. These are open for
further work.
