On Two Unicast Wireless Networks with
Destination-to-Source Feedback

capacity region if and only if the non-feedback capacity region
of the network is T12 or T21 . Moreover, the capacity region is
always enlarged to the pentagon region P. Therefore, the category of networks with feedback capacity region being P is the
union of those with non-feedback capacity regions T12 , T21 ,
and P. In a word, the class of two unicast linear deterministic
network can be classiﬁed into only three categories according
to their feedback capacity regions: {T, P, S}. Since bounds on
2R1 + R2 and R1 + 2R2 are no longer active in characterizing
the capacity region, in principle the role of feedback is similar
to that in the two-user interference channel.
For the achievability, we provide a coding scheme that
exploits feedback for utilizing side information at destinations
for the category of networks with non-feedback capacity
region T12 (or T21 ), so that the rate pair (1, 1/2) (or (1/2, 1))
is achievable. For the outer bounds, we modify the proof of
the non-feedback outer bounds by introducing new Markov
relations taking the feedback into account, and show that the
sum rate outer bounds still hold with the presence of feedback.
An important scenario of multiple unicast wireless networks
is the Gaussian network. Recently, the degrees of freedom
(DoF) region is completely characterized for layered two
unicast Gaussian networks without feedback [8]. The result resembles that in the linear deterministic case [7] with a change
of performance measure from rate to DoF. We conjecture
that the conclusion of the current paper regarding the role
of feedback can be extended to the Gaussian network. This
direction is left as future work.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we formulate the problem and deﬁne the network model.
In Sec. III, we ﬁrst review the non-feedback result adapted
from [7] and provide the minimal necessary deﬁnitions for
presenting the main theorem. Then in Sec. IV we present our
feedback capacity result. A motivating example is given in
Sec. V. The achievability proof is in Section VI, while the
converse proofs are left in an extended version [9].

Abstract—In this paper we study the role of feedback in
layered two unicast wireless networks with arbitrary number of
nodes and connectivity. The feedback model allows destinations to
feedback their received signals to their respective sources. In the
case of linear deterministic networks, we fully characterize the
capacity region when the two individual minimum cut values are
equal to 1 and show that feedback only helps increase capacity
whenever the capacity region without feedback has (1, 1/2) or
(1/2, 1) as its corner point but not both. Therefore, feedback
helps balance the resource utilization of the two users, similar to
the role of feedback in the two-user interference channel [1].

I. I NTRODUCTION
In multi-user wireless networks, feedback helps balance the
resource utilization among different users [1] by treating part
of the interference received at destinations as useful side information. Through the feedback from destinations to sources,
the side information can be exploited efﬁciently, and the
system resource utilization is balanced across different users.
In the context of the two-user interference channel, in the
approximate characterization of the feedback capacity region,
only the sum rate upper bound and the two individual rate
bounds are active. In contrast, when feedback is not available
[2], additionally bounds on 2R1 + R2 and R1 + 2R2 will be
active, which implies that resource utilization is not balanced
in certain regimes. The resource utilization interpretation [1]
is best visualized using the linear deterministic model [3].
Channel output feedback in interference channels with constant channel gains has been well studied [4] [1] [5] [6]. With
a good understanding on the role of feedback in single-hop
multi-user networks, one of the natural follow-up questions is
whether or not it extends to networks with arbitrary number of
nodes and connectivity. In this paper we make a step towards
answering this question by studying a class of layered two
unicast linear deterministic networks [3] where the channel
strengths are either unity or zero and the individual minimum
cut values are equal to 1. This class of networks was studied
in the previous work [7] when feedback is not available. The
non-feedback capacity region is completely characterized in
[7], and similar to the two-user interference chanel [2], there
are networks where in the characterization of the capacity
region, bounds on 2R1 +R2 or R1 +2R2 are active. Moreover,
the class of two unicast linear deterministic networks can
be partitioned into ﬁve different categories according to their
capacity regions: {T, T12 , T21 , P, S}, as shown in Fig. 1.
Our main result is that, when feedback is available from the
destinations to their respective sources, it helps increase the

let Ksi (v) := {u : P si (u) = P si (v)} , i = 1, 2, the set of
nodes that have the same si -reachable parents as v. We
called these nodes the si -clones of v.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (Vertex Cut): For two sets of nodes U1 and
U2 , we say a collection of nodes T is a (U1 ; U2 )-vertex-cut
if in the graph obtained from the deletion of T , there are no
paths from any node in U1 \ T to any node in U2 \ T . Note
that this deﬁnition allows T to have nodes from U1 or U2 .
Deﬁnition 3.3 (Omniscient Nodes): We say a node v 2 V
is omniscient if it satisﬁes either of (A) or (B) below:
(A) K(v) is a (s1 , s2 ; d1 )-vertex-cut and Ks2 (v) is a (s2 ; d2 )vertex-cut.
(B) K(v) is a (s1 , s2 ; d2 )-vertex-cut and Ks1 (v) is a (s1 ; d1 )vertex-cut.
Deﬁnition 3.4 (Critical Nodes): For each i = 1, 2, we de⇤
ﬁne the critical node vi as any node with the smallest possible
⇤
layer index such that K(vi ) is a (s1 , s2 ; di )-vertex-cut. We use
⇤
⇤ to denote the layer where critical nodes v
L ki
i lies.
⇤
A key property of the critical node vi is that, its reception
completely determines the reception of destination di .
Deﬁnition 3.5 (Cut Value and Min-Cut): Fix a set of nodes
in layer k, U ✓ Lk . Consider a partition of V into (T , T c )
with s1 , s2 2 T and U ✓ T c . Construct the transfer matrix
G with rows indexed by elements of T and columns indexed
by elements of T c where the (u, w) entry of G is 1 if there
is a directed edge from u to w and 0 otherwise. The rankmincut [3] from {s1 , s2 } to U is deﬁned as the minimum rank
of the transfer matrix G over all such partitions (T , T c ), and
is denoted by C (s1 .s2 ; U ).
Once we deﬁne the cut value, we can deﬁne primary mincut nodes for any set of nodes U with C (s1 , s2 ; U ) = 1, due
to the following lemma. What these primary min-cut nodes
receive determines what U receive.
Lemma 3.1 (Primary Min-Cut): By Ul , 0  l < k, denote
the set of nodes in layer Ll that can reach some node in U .
Let l⇤ be the minimum index such that C(s1 , s2 ; Ul⇤ ) = 1.
Then, Ul⇤ ✓ K(u) for any u 2 Ul⇤ , i.e. nodes in Ul⇤ are all
clones of each other. We then deﬁne any of the nodes in K(u)
as the primary min-cut node of U , denoted by Pmc (U ). It is
unique up to clones.
Note that the reception of any node in U is a function of the
reception of Pmc (U ).
Next, we deﬁne induced graph G12 (w) for a node w 2

P s2 (v1 ) as follows. The purpose of these induced graphs is
two-fold: 1) to capture the effect on the rest of the network

The notation X := {X[1], . . . , X[t]} for t 1 and X 0 := ;.
Note that in the above formulation, we do not include the
feedback links from the destinations to their respective sources
into the graph G. Hence, throughout this paper, any graph
theoretic properties and conditions are associated to the graph
G itself, not including the feedback links.
The channel model we consider is a special case of the linear
deterministic network from [3]. The simpliﬁcation is that if
there is a link from one node to another, then the channel
strength is unity. The reception of a node L the binary XOR
is
of the transmission of its parents: Yv [t] = u2P(v) Xu [t].

III. BACKGROUND [7]

For completeness, below we ﬁrst summarize the deﬁnitions
in [7] for the case without feedback. These deﬁnitions play
equally important roles in the feedback result. For a better
exposition and illustraion please check [7]. Then we review
the known result in the case without feedback, which lays the
foundation for deriving the feedback result.

of the two destination nodes. Without loss of generality we
assume each node in the network can be reached by at least
one of the source nodes and can reach at least one of the
destination nodes. For each node v 2 V \ {s1 , s2 }, we deﬁne
nodes that can reach v as its predecessors. Let P(v) denote the
set of predecessors that can reach v in one step. We will call
the nodes in P(v) as the parents of v. A node is si -reachable
if it can be reached by si . It is si -only-reachable if it can be
reached by si but not sj , j 6= i. It is s1 s2 -reachable if it can
be reached by both s1 and s2 .
Each source si , i = 1, 2, has its own message Wi to be
transmitted to its own destination di at rate Ri , and {W1 , W2 }
are independent. Let Xu [t] and Yu [t] denote the transmitted and
received signals of node u at time t respectively. Due to the
causal processing at each node, for any t 1,

The following theorem summarizes the main result for the
two unicast linear deterministic networks with feedback.
Theorem 4.1 (Capacity Region with Feedback): The
capacity region of two unicast ﬂows over the linear
deterministic networks with destination-to-source feedback is
characterized as follows:

where

B) [ (B \ A). We then drop nodes in G12 (w) that cannot be
reached by either of the two sources. In the rest of this paper, a
graph theoretic object with a graph (say, G12 ) in its subscript,
like PG12 (w) (u) above, denote the graph theoretic object in the
induced graph G12 .
Similarly we can deﬁne G21 (w) with indices 1 and 2 swapped.

We will use G12 (w) when k1  k2 and G21 (w) when k2 
⇤
k1 . We will only use these graphs in relation to whether or
not there is an omniscient node in G12 (w). Lemma 3.2 below
allows us to drop the w and refer to any of the G12 (w) as G12
and talk about whether there is an omniscient node in G12 .
Lemma 3.2: Suppose, in a network with no omniscient

node, and with k1  k2 , there exists a node w0 2 P s2 (v1 )
such that there is an omniscient node in G12 (w0 ). Then for any
⇤
node w 2 P s2 (v1 ), there is an omniscient node in G12 (w).

We deﬁne T

(12)
s2

• T4
: w12 = s2 , i.e., P (v1 ) cannot be reached by s1 .
Symmetrically, we can deﬁne condition T(21) simply by swapping the indices 1 and 2 in the superscript.
Similarly, deﬁne P(12) as the conjunction of the following:

Finally, deﬁne Q(12) := T(12) _ P(12) and it is the conjunction of the following:

: Ks2 (w12 ) forms an (s2 ; d2 )-vertex-cut in G.
We use the following shorthand notations: O :=
{9 an omniscient node}, T := T(12) _T(21) , P := P(12) _P(21) ,
and Q := Q(12) _ Q(21) = T _ P. Also, in the context that no
confusion will be caused, we use the same notation to denote
the set of networks that satisfy the condition.
Theorem 3.1 (Capacity Region without Feedback [7]):
The capacity region of two unicast ﬂows over the linear
deterministic networks without feedback is characterized as
follows: the left-hand side denotes the collection of networks
satisfying the condition, and the right-hand side denotes the
capacity region of that collection of networks.

Remark 4.1: Note that compared to the case without feedback as shown in Theorem 3.1, the only difference is that,
in any network belonging to the class T(12) \ O or the class
T(21) \ O, one can make use of feedback to enlarge the
capacity region to the pentagon region P. Therefore, to prove
Theorem 4.1, we only need to prove the following:
1) Achievability: By symmetry, it sufﬁces to show that for a
network that belongs to T(12) \ O, when destination-to-source
feedback is available, the rate pair (1, 1/2) is achievable.
2) Converse: Show that for a network that belongs to the class
O, its achievable sum rate R1 + R2  1, and for a network
that belongs to the class Q \ O, 2R1 + 2R2  3.
Due to space constraint, proof of the converse part is left
in [9]. Below we summarize the two key lemmas that prove
the converse part, and the details can be found in [9].
Lemma 4.1: If there exists an omniscient node as deﬁned in
Deﬁnition 3.3 in the two-unicast linear deterministic network,
then for any achievable rate pair (R1 , R2 ), R1 + R2  1.
Lemma 4.2: If the two-unicast linear deterministic network satisﬁes condition Q, then for any achievable rate pair
(R1 , R2 ), 2R1 + 2R2  3.
V. A M OTIVATING E XAMPLE
Before we go into the details of the proof, let us investigate
an example network that belongs to the class T(12) \ O, and
show that indeed (R1 , R2 ) = (1, 1/2) is achievable if sourceto-destination feedback is available. Moreover the sum rate
R1 + R2 is still upper bounded by 3/2.

Consider the example illustrated in Fig. 2(a). First of all, let
us check its properties and show that it satisﬁes the condition
T(12) . In this example, the critical node for user 1 is the node
u4 , while that for user 2 is the destination d2 . Moreover, it is
easy to check that there is no omniscient node by checking
the two critical nodes [7]. In particular, for the node u4 ,
its s2 -reachable parents P s2 (u4 ) = {u2 } and hence its s2 clones Ks2 (u4 ) = {u4 , u5 }. But the removal of {u4 , u5 } cannot
separate d2 from s2 , and hence the node u4 does not satisfy
the deﬁnition of an omniscient node.
Next, let us check that condition T(12) is satisﬁed.
(12)
• T1
: Here the critical node for user 1 lies in a layer with
⇤
⇤
index smaller than that for user 2. Hence k1 < k2 .
(12)
• T2
: The critical node for user 1, u4 , has only one s2 reachable parent, which is the node u2 . Hence we have
C (s1 , s2 ; P s2 (u4 )) = 1. Moreover, since u2 can only be
reached by s2 , the primary min-cut node of it, w12 =
Pmc (u2 ) = s2 .
(12)
• T3
: The induced graph G12 (u2 ) is depicted in Fig. 2(b).
Hence we see that indeed u21 := PmcG12 (d2 ) = u6 is
omniscient in G12 .
(12)
• T4
: Indeed w12 = s2 as shown above.
Therefore, if destination-to-source feedback is not available,
the capacity region of this network is the region T12 [7],
and (R1 , R2 ) = (1, 1/2) cannot be achieved. With feedback,
however, this rate pair is achievable. Below we describe a
simple scheme over two time slots to achieve it. See Fig. 3 for
an illustration. We aim to deliver two binary symbols {a1 , a2 }
from s1 to d1 and one binary symbol {b} from s2 to d2 over
two time slots. At the ﬁrst time slot, each node transmits what
it receives except the node u2 , with s1 transmitting a1 and s2
transmitting b. The node u2 keeps silent at the ﬁrst time slot.
Hence d1 receives a1 , while d2 receives a1 b. At the second
time slot, using the feedback from d2 , the source s2 obtains
a1 . At this time slot, each node transmits what it receives
except the node u6 , with s1 transmitting a2 and s2 transmitting
a1 . The node u6 keeps silent at the second time slot. Hence
d1 receives a1 a2 , while d2 receives a1 . Therefore, both
user’s symbols are delivered to their respective destinations
successfully, and the rate pair (R1 , R2 ) = (1, 1/2) is achieved.

B. Case: 0 < k1 < k2
Again we aim to deliver two symbols {a1 , a2 } from s1 to
d1 and one symbol b from s2 to d2 over two time slots. At
time t = 1, every node performs RLC with s1 sending a1
⇤
and s2 sending b except for one node, say w, in P s2 (v1 ).
s2 ⇤
This node w 2 P (v1 ) has to choose its scaling coefﬁcient
⇤

carefully so that the aggregate of P s2 (v1 )’s transmission at v1
becomes 0 (interference neutralization). This is because under
⇤
condition T(12) , P s2 (v1 ) are s2 -only-reachable. Therefore,
under the interference neutralization, in effect the network
becomes G12 (w). In G12 (w) the destination d1 becomes s1 ⇤
only-reachable. Hence d1 can decode a1 , while v2 receives a
linear combination of a1 and b. The coefﬁcient of b is non-zero

with high probability since v1 is not omniscient and therefore

in G12 (w), s2 can reach v2 [7]. This linear combination is then
fed back to s2 , and it now knows a1 before the transmission
of time t = 2.
At time t = 2, every node performs RLC with s1 sending
⇤
a2 and s2 sending a1 , except the nodes in P (v2 ). Since by
⇤
the deﬁnition of critical nodes, C (s1 , s2 ; P (v2 )) = 2, we can
⇤
arrange their transmission carefully so that v2 can decode a1 .
⇤
Hence, v2 can decode b by combining it with the previous
received linear combination of {a1 , b}. Such arrangement in
⇤
⇤
P (v2 ), as v2 is not omniscient, guarantees that d1 can still
receive a linear combination of a1 and a2 with non-zero a2 coefﬁcient [7]. Hence, d1 can decode a2 as well.

VI. ACHIEVABILITY P ROOF
As mentioned in Remark 4.1, for the achievability part we
only need to show that, for a network that belongs to the class
T(12) \ O, when feedback from destinations to their respective
sources is available, the rate pair (1, 1/2) is achievable.
Following the same line as the achievability proof in the
non-feedback case [7], we without loss of generality assume
⇤
⇤
that k1  k2 and distinguish into two different cases:1 1)
⇤
⇤
⇤
⇤
0 < k1 = k2 = k ⇤ , and 2) 0 < k1 < k2 .
⇤
⇤
A. Case: 0 < k1 = k2 = k ⇤

In this case, we recall a lemma from [7] which captures
the pattern of networks belonging to T(12) \ O when the two
⇤
⇤
critical nodes are in the same layer. Let P1 := P (v1 ) \P (v2 ),
⇤
⇤
⇤
⇤
P2 := P (v2 ) \ P (v1 ), P12 := P (v1 ) \ P (v2 ).
⇤
⇤
Lemma 6.1 ([7]): When k1 = k2 = k ⇤ and there is no
omniscient node, we have the following equivalence relation2 :
T(12) \ O ()
8
> P1 is s1 -only-reachable
>
<
C (s1 , s2 ; P2 ) = 1, u21 := Pmc (P2 ) 6= si , i = 1, 2
> P12 is s2 -only-reachable
> s
:
K 1 (u21 ) forms (s1 ; d1 ) -vertex-cut.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
The author would like to thank Dr. Changho Suh for the
fruitful discussion that sparked his interest in investigating the
role of feedback in two unicast wireless networks. The work
of I-Hsiang Wang was supported by EU project CONECT
FP7-ICT-2009-257616.

Using this lemma, below we prove that (1, 1/2) can be
achieved using linear schemes over extension ﬁeld F2q (where
q is the effective block length), as deﬁned in [7].
We aim to deliver two F2q -symbols {a1 , a2 } from s1 to
⇤
⇤
v1 and one symbol b from s2 to v2 over two time slots,
respectively. At time t = 1, every node performs random
linear coding (RLC, where each node transmits a uniformly
randomly chosen linear transformation in F2q of its received
symbol, as deﬁned in [7]) with s1 sending a1 and s2 sending
b, except that the nodes in P12 have to keep silent. As a result,
⇤
since P1 are s1 -only-reachable and P12 are silent, v1 can
⇤
decode a1 with high probability and so can d1 . v2 (and hence
d2 ), however, will receive a scaled version of the reception of
u21 . Since u21 6= si , i = 1, 2, it is s1 s2 -reachable, and hence
d2 ’s reception is a linear combination of a1 and b. This linear
combination is then fed back to s2 , and it now knows a1 before
the transmission of time t = 2.
At time t = 2, every node performs RLC with s1 sending
a2 and s2 sending a1 , except that the nodes in P2 have to
⇤
keep silent. Consequently, v1 (and hence d1 ) receives a linear
⇤
combination of a1 and a2 and hence can decode a2 . v2 (and
hence d2 ) receives a scaled version of a1 , and can decode b by
combining it with the previously received linear combination
of {a1 , b}.

1 Note that as pointed out in Lemma 3.1 in [7], if k ⇤ = 0 and there is no
1
omniscient node, then (1, 1) is achievable.
2 In [7], the left-hand side is originally written as T(12) rather than T(12) \O,

which is equivalent as under k1 = k2 = k⇤ , T(12) \ O = ;.
