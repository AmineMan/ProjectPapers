user. This optimal energy balancing between exploration and
exploitation can be cast as a fundamental decision-making
problem on how many channels should be chosen to sense and
probe with dedicated energy—namely, how much pure exploration is required for the active sensing OSA bandit problem.
Speciﬁcally, taking into account independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) channel fading over both channels and time
blocks, we put forth a proactive strategy for determining the
optimal sensing cardinality (the number of channels chosen
to sense) and probing cardinality (the number of channels
chosen to probe) that maximize the average throughput of the
secondary user with limited available frame energy.

Abstract—In this paper, we consider a wideband cognitive
radio network with limited available frame energy and treat a
fundamental energy allocation problem: how available energy
should be optimally allocated for sensing, probing, and data
transmission to maximize the achievable average opportunistic
spectrum access (OSA) throughput. By casting this problem
into the multi-armed bandit framework under probably approximately correct learning, we put forth a proactive strategy for
determining the optimal sensing cardinality and probing cardinality that maximize the average throughput of the secondary user.
Numerical results show that our framework gives the the optimal
diversity–energy tradeoff for the average OSA throughput.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Since the allocated frequency bands to some licensed spectrum holders experience very low utilization, the opening of
under-utilized portions of the licensed spectrum for secondary
reuse is considered by employing the opportunistic spectrum
access and cognitive radio technology [1]. However, the main
challenge in dynamic spectrum access is that secondary users
are required to accurately detect and rapidly access the idle
spectrum, without causing harmful interference to primary
radio transmissions [2].
The secondary users can have more than one frequency band
(channel) to sense and to decide on which channel is suitable
for data transmission [3]. However, when a large number
of channels is open for cognitive users to opportunistically
access, it is energy-inefﬁcient or even infeasible due to hardware limitations to simultaneously or continuously sense all
available channels. In contrast, if the secondary user chooses
one or a subset of possible channels to sense and access
at a time, it is crucial for efﬁcient opportunistic spectrum
access (OSA) to design a channel selection strategy for the
spectrum sensing, leading to ﬁnd an idle channel as quickly as
possible. Therefore, in a dilemmatic situation such as energylimited applications with a large number of channels, it is
of great importance for the cognitive user to resourcefully
utilize available energy for exploration and exploitation. In
fact, such an exploration–exploitation tradeoff is the essence
of the bandit problems [4].
In this paper, applying the probably approximation correct
(PAC) multi-armed bandit problem (MABP) formulation for
the active sensing OSA problem, we treat an optimal energy allocation for sensing, probing, and data transmission to
maximize the achievable average throughput of the secondary

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider an energy-limited wideband cognitive radio
network, where Nch frequency bands (channels) are modeled
by doubly block fading, i.e, block fading in time and in
frequency.
A. Channel Model and Spectrum Opportunity
Each channel has the same bandwidth and experiences
i.i.d. ﬂat Rayleigh fading. The fading coefﬁcient of each
channel remains constant within a block of coherence time
Tc and changes independently from one block to the other.
Therefore, the Rayleigh-fading coefﬁcients remain constant for
each block of Tc time interval and mutually independent across
different blocks and channels. Using a hierarchical access
structure with spectrum overlay, each channel is licensed to
the primary users while the secondary users have opportunistic
access to it. We model the primary spectrum occupancy in
each channel according to an independent Bernoulli process
with two states, namely, “0 (idle)” and “1 (busy)” states. The
spectrum occupancy state is kept ﬁxed in each frame of Tf
time interval (or L coherence blocks, i.e., Tf = LTc ) and
changes independently in the next frame, as in [5]–[7]. Let Õi
be the probability that the ith channel is in the busy state for
each frame, which is known a priori to the secondary user.
Then, the spectrum occupancy state of the ith channel obeys
the Bernoulli process ÖÒ (Õi ) over frames.1 We rearrange the
statistics Õi ’s in increasing order as Õ[1] ≤ Õ[2] ≤ . . . ≤ Õ[Nsub ] .

use

ÖÒ (p) to denote a Bernoulli distribution with mean p.

B. Spectrum Access Mechanism and Signal Model

III. P ROACTIVE C ARDINALITY D ESIGNS
A. Deﬁnitions

In each frame, the secondary user chooses a set of best
channels in terms of the statistics Õi ’s to sense, which is referred to as the spectrum sensing set S ⊆ C = {1, 2, . . . , Nch }
and its cardinality |S| as the sensing cardinality. After sensing
these channels with energy consumption Es , the secondary user
determines a set of channels sensed as idle in S, denoted by
Sidle ⊆ S. For active sensing, the secondary user chooses a set
of best channels (again in terms of the statistics Õi ’s) in Sidle ,
which is referred to as the spectrum probing set P ⊆ Sidle and
its cardinality |P| as the probing cardinality. Then, for every
coherence block of frame, consuming the probing energy Ep ,
the secondary user probes channels in P to access the best
channel for data transmission. Note that for a singleton probing
set (|P| = 1), the secondary user has access to the channel in
|P| without probing it (Ep = 0).
To prolong network lifetime without energy depletion and
limit network interference caused by the secondary users,
the energy Etot per frame is dedicated for sensing, probing
and data transmission. Under this energy constraint Etot , the
secondary user attempts to optimally allocate a part of the
energy for sensing and probing while using the remaining
energy for data transmission. If the ith channel is chosen to
access for data transmission during the sensing and probing
phases, the secondary user transmits data with power P over
this chosen channel in the corresponding time block and the
received signal over the ith channel can be expressed as
√
ËÆÊ1 Ài su + Ï , if the channel is idle,
√
√
i =
ËÆÊ1 Ài su + ËÆÊ2 i pu + Ï , otherwise,
(1)

Let Ôf and Ôm be the false alarm probability and miss detection probability of the secondary user for detecting the primary
spectrum occupancy of each channel. Then, the probability
that the ith channel is sensed to be idle is given by

Ôi (idle) = (1 − Ôf ) (1 − Õi ) + Ôm Õi .

(2)

If the ith channel is chosen to access, the secondary user
achieves a data rate in nats/s/Hz as
i

= (1 − ψi ) ln 1 + ËÆÊ1 |Ài |
+ ψi ln 1 +

ËÆÊ1 |Ài |2
2
1 + ËÆÊ2 | i |

,

(3)

where ψi = Ôm Õi /Ôi (idle) denotes the probability that the ith
channel is occupied by the primary user, conditioned on the
event that the secondary user senses this channel to be idle.

(4)

which is equal to the achievable rate for ideal perfect sensing
(Ôf = Ôm = 0).
Deﬁnition 1 (Sensing Energy Figure): Let E0 be the energy
cost per channel for sensing, called the unit sensing energy.
Then, the sensing energy ﬁgure (SEF), denoted by ζ ∈ [0, 1],
is deﬁned as the ratio between the unit sensing energy and
frame energy, that is, ζ = E0 /Etot .
Deﬁnition 2 (Transmission Energy Figure): The transmission energy ﬁgure (TEF), denoted by η ∈ [0, 1], is deﬁned
as the ratio between total data transmission energy and frame
energy, that is, η = 1 − (Es + LEp ) /Etot .
Deﬁnition 3 (Average Regularity Throughput): Let R be
the achievable average rate (nats/s/Hz) of the secondary user
for data transmission with transmit power P in each frame.
Then, the average regularity throughput as a function of the
TEF η is deﬁned as Êrt (η) = ηR nats/s/Hz.

where su is the transmitted signal from the secondary
2
user with E | su |
= 1; pu is the primary signal with
2
= 1; Ài ∼ CN (0, 1) and i ∼ CN (0, 1)
E | pu |
are Rayleigh-fading channel coefﬁcients from the secondary
and primary users to the secondary receiver, respectively;
and Ï ∼ CN (0, 1) is the complex additive white Gaussian
noise. The quantities ËÆÊ1 and ËÆÊ2 denote the average
received signal-to-noise ratios at the secondary receiver for
the secondary and primary signals, respectively. Note that
the second case in (1) corresponds to the miss detection of
the primary signal, which is likely to happen at a low level
of the primary signal at the secondary transmitter in typical
spectrum sensing. Due to limited available frame energy, we
ﬁx the secondary transmission power in both probing and
data transmission phases such that the interference power at
the primary receiver is controlled to be small for this miss
detection case. We further consider the following channel state
information (CSI) model at the secondary transceiver pair: i)
the transmitter does not know all the channel coefﬁcients Ài ,
i ∈ C, at all; ii) before identifying an access channel, the
receiver knows only the phases of channel coefﬁcients Ài ,
i ∈ P, at least for active sensing; and iii) with channel training
after access decision making, the receiver has perfect CSI on
the channel chosen to access.

B. ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC MEA for Channel Probing
For channel probing, the secondary user attempts to test
channels in the probing set P using the ( , δ, α, β, A)-PAC
MEA [8]. In the probing phase, the secondary user sends
the sequence of unit-energy testing signals Xtest over each
channel in P for channel probing, where Xtest ∈ {1, −1}
is a binary phase-shift keying signal known to the receiver.
Then, in the presence of phase CSI, the receiver duplicates
Xtest using the maximum-likelihood detection, i.e., ˆi =
arg minX∈{1,−1} |Îi − X Ài |2 for the ith channel, i ∈ P,
and declares error if ˆi = Xtest , where Îi is the received
signal for the test Xtest over the ith channel and Ài is the
channel tracking coefﬁcient, which has the unit amplitude and
the same phase as the channel Ài . By counting errors in each
channel, the receiver generates a set of channels for the next
stage in the ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC MEA and feedbacks it to the
˘
secondary. By letting ˘i , Xtest ∈ {0, 1} be the demodulated

2

versions of ˆi and Xtest respectively, conditioned on |Ài |
and | i |, we can model these test communications over the
ith channel as a binary symmetric channel with crossover

idle state, and otherwise

For passive sensing without any probing mechanism to
assess the quality of channels in Sidle , the secondary user
chooses a channel with the smallest Õi in Sidle to access for
data transmission. This policy can be viewed as a special case
of active sensing with a singleton probing set (|P| = 1) at
the TEF η = 1 − ζ|S|. Therefore, using Theorem 1 with
|P (|Sidle |)| = 1, we get the achievable regularity throughput

Average regularity throughput (nats/s/Hz)

In this section, we provide some numerical results to
demonstrate the effect of optimal energy allocation in the
active sensing OSA. In all examples, we set Nch = 100,
ËÆÊ1 = 15 dB, ËÆÊ2 = −10 dB , E0 = 50000 energy units,
L = 10, Ôm = 0.1, and Ôf = 0.1. In the ( , δ, α , β , P)-PAC
MEA for channel probing, we set = 0.1 and δ = 0.1. For
this correctness policy, we set the values of α and β to the
asymptotically optimal pair (α = 0.8038, β = 0.7739).
Fig. 1 shows the average regularity throughput Êrt (η)
as a function of spectrum occupancy heterogeneity θ when
θ
Õi = 0.5 + 100 (i − 50) for ËÆÊ2 = −10 dB and ζ = 10−2 .
In this example, we can see that Êrt (η) increases (but not
signiﬁcantly) as the primary spectrum occupancy becomes
more heterogeneous among channels (i.e., θ increases). This
is due to that fact that the secondary user chooses a set
of channels with low occupancy history Õi for sensing and
probing. At low ËÆÊ2 , we see again that the upper bound (9)
is still tight and agrees almost exactly with the simulation
result for the heterogeneous case. Fig. 2 shows Êrt (η) as
a function of ζ for ËÆÊ2 = −10 dB and heterogeneous
occupancy Õi = 0.75 + 0.005 (i − 50). The optimal active
sensing keeps the throughput advantage for the heterogeneous
occupancy Õi ’s by optimally balancing the energy for sensing,
probing, and data transmission.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the optimal energy allocation
for energy-constrained active cognitive radios. Using the PAC
MABP formulation, we presented the OSA policy with optimal
active sensing, which enables the cognitive user to optimally
balance available frame energy between exploration (sensing
and probing) and exploitation (data transmission). Specifically, reﬁning the ( , δ)-PAC action elimination algorithm
for channel probing, we put forth the proactive strategy for
determining the optimal sensing and probing cardinalities that
maximize the throughput of the secondary user with limited
available frame energy. This optimal active sensing achieves

a considerable throughput gain over (even optimal) passive
sensing, by cultivating the diversity yet preserving residual
energy for data transmission.

where (16) follows from (6); (17) follows from the -optimality
of the algorithm; and the last inequality (18) is attained by
perfect sensing. To evaluate
