Abstract— In multiantenna broadcast channels without channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), orthogonal transmission (e.g., TDMA) is known to achieve maximal degrees of
freedom either with perfect channel state information at receiver
(CSIR), or when no receiver has CSIR. Recently, it has been
shown [1] that TDMA is no longer optimal in cases of unequal
CSIR, e.g., when one receiver has CSIR and another does not.
This paper proposes a multiplicative superposition that attains
degrees of freedom uniformly higher than [1] and TDMA. The
proposed scheme uses coherent signaling for the receiver with
CSIR, and Grassmannian signaling for the receiver without
CSIR. This signaling structure is shown to attain the optimal
degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna conﬁgurations.

I. I NTRODUCTION

We consider a broadcast channel with an M -antenna transmitter and two receivers. One of the receivers has access
to channel state information, and is referred to as the static
receiver. The other receiver has no channel state information,
e.g., due to mobility, and is referred to as the dynamic receiver.
The dynamic receiver has N 1 antennas and the static receiver
has N2 antennas (N1 ≤ N2 ). Denote the channel coefﬁcient
matrix from the transmitter to the dynamic and static receivers
by H1 ∈ C N1 ×M and H2 ∈ C N2 ×M , respectively. We
assume that H1 is constant for intervals of T symbols, and
is unknown by either receiver. The channel coefﬁcient matrix
H2 is perfectly known by the static receiver but unknown by
the dynamic receiver. 1
Over T time-slots (symbols), the transmitter sends a signal
matrix X = [x1 , · · · , xM ]t over M antennas, where x i ∈
C T ×1 is the transmitted signal vector over the antenna i.
The normalized signal at the dynamic and static receivers is
respectively

For multiuser MIMO broadcast channels, degrees of freedom depends strongly on the channel knowledge at the
transmitter and receiver. With channel-state information at the
receiver (CSIR) and transmitter (CSIT), it is advantageous to
simultaneously transmit to multiple receivers [2]. With CSIR
but no CSIT, orthogonal transmission (e.g., TDMA) achieves
optimal degrees of freedom [2], [3]. With neither CSIT nor
CSIR, again TDMA achieves the best possible degrees of
freedom [4].
Recently, we have shown [1] that TDMA is no longer
optimal if the receivers have unequal CSIR, e.g., one receiver
has full CSIR and another has no CSIR. A superposition
signaling that broadcasts to two receivers on Grassmannian
achieves higher multiplexing gain than TDMA.
The study of broadcast channels with varying CSIR is
motivated by downlink scenarios where users have different
mobilities. The low-mobility users have the opportunity to
reliably estimate their channels, while the high-mobility users
do not have the same opportunity.
This paper studies the broadcast channel with unequal CSIR,
and proposes a superposition signaling that achieves degrees
of freedom uniformly higher than [1]. It is shown that the
proposed signaling attains the optimal degrees of freedom
under a wide set of antenna conﬁgurations. In the proposed
scheme, the signals of the two receivers are multiplied to
produce the broadcast signal. The information for the receiver
with CSIR (the static receiver) is carried by the signal matrix
values (coherent signaling), while the information for the
receiver without CSIR (the dynamic receiver) is transported
on the Grassmannian. The static receiver is required to perform interference decoding of the dynamic signal, while the
dynamic receiver decodes by treating the static signal as noise.

therefore, in the normalized channel model given by (1), we

receiver, its time variation (or lack thereof) does not play any role in the

minimal description of the requirements for the results, we only state that
H2 is known.

When transmitting to the dynamic receiver, it is optimal if the
transmitter activates only K out of M antennas, and sends
pilots from the K antennas sequentially over the ﬁrst K timeslots. Then, the transmitter sends data during the remaining
(T − K) time-slots [6], [8]. The maximum rate achieved by
the dynamic receiver is:

We assume H1 has i.i.d. entries with zero mean and unit
variance but do not assign any speciﬁc distribution for H 1 .
This general model includes Rayleigh fading as a special case,
where the entries of H 1 are i.i.d. CN (0, 1). For H 2 the channel
is assumed to have full column (or row) rank; this assumption
holds with probability 1 if H 2 has i.i.d. and continuous valued
entries. The transmitter has no channel state information.

A. Non-coherent Point-to-point Channels

We now propose a superposition signaling that attains
uniformly higher degrees of freedom than orthogonal transmission and the signaling in [1].
A. A Toy Example
Consider M = N1 = N2 = 1 and T = 2. Our approach is
that over 2 time-slots, the transmitter sends

where x1 =

the two receivers. The signal at the dynamic receiver is

where h1 is the channel coefﬁcient of the dynamic receiver,
˜
and h1 h1 x2 is the equivalent channel coefﬁcient obtained
by absorbing the signal of the other receiver into the channel
coefﬁcient. The dynamic receiver can determine the row space
˜
spanned by x 1 even though h1 is unknown (but non-zero).
The total degrees of freedom conveyed by x 1 is 1 (thus 1 per
2
time-slot); this is the maximum degrees of freedom for any
strategy under the same number of antennas and coherence
time, therefore it is optimal.
For the static receiver, the received signal is:

where T is the channel coherence time, i.e., the number of
symbols that the channel remains constant. Therefore, the
optimal signals are K × T unitary matrices. These unitary
matrices reside in G(T, K) and each is interpreted as a
representation of the subspace it spans. This method achieves
the maximum degrees of freedom (over T time-slots)
K(T − K).

III. G RASSMANNIAN -E UCLIDEAN S UPERPOSITION

We brieﬂy introduce the basic of communication over
Grassmannian (see [6], [7] for more details). Consider a pointto-point M × N MIMO channel where the receiver does not
know the channel H, i.e., a non-coherent channel. At high
SNR the additive noise is negligible, so the received signal
Y ≈ HX, where X is the transmitted signal. Since X is
multiplied by a random and unknown H, the receiver cannot
decode the exact X. Nevertheless, the multiplication of H
does not affect the subspace speciﬁed by X: for any nonsingular H, the received signal Y spans the same row space
as X. Therefore, the row space of X can be used to carry
information even without knowing H, i.e., the information is
mapped into signal matrices with different row spaces.
For non-coherent MIMO channels, the design of an optimal
signaling can be viewed as sphere packing over Grassmannian [6]. At high SNR, the optimal signals are isotropically
distributed unitary matrices [7], [6]. The optimal number of
transmit antenna K depends on the channel coherence time:
K = min(M, N, T /2 ),

B. A Baseline Scheme: Orthogonal Transmission
We consider an orthogonal (TDMA) and training-based 2
method as a baseline for comparison. The transmitter communicates with the two receivers in a time-sharing manner.

whose generalization is the subject of this subsection. A key
feature of this method is that the static receiver decodes and
removes the dynamic signal. Due to limited space, we focus
on the case of N 1 ≤ N2 in this paper.
The transmitter sends X ∈ C N2 ×T over a coherence interval
T , where N2 = M , i.e., using N2 out of M antennas:

is uniquely represented by a signal matrix). Then, the static

where X1 ∈ C N1 ×T and X2 ∈ C N2 ×N1 are signals for the
dynamic receiver and the static receiver, respectively. The
signal X1 is from a Grassmannian codebook X 1 ⊂ G(T, N1 ),
while X2 is from a conventional Gaussian codebook X 2 . In the
√ √
above equation T / N1 N2 is a power normalizing factor.
We give a sketch of argument for the degrees of freedom
attained by the superposition signaling (16) (for a complete
proof see Appendix I). For the dynamic receiver, at high SNR,
Y1 ≈ H1 X2 X1 . When N1 ≤ N2 , the equivalent channel
H1 X2 is an N1 ×N1 square matrix with full rank, which does
not change the row space of X 1 . Recovering the row space of
X1 produces (T − N 1 )N1 degrees of freedoms (see (4)).
For the static receiver, the signal at high SNR is

Y2 ≈ H2 X2 X1 = H2 X1 .

(17)

For N1 ≤ N2 , H2 = H2 X2 is a tall matrix that has full
column rank (with probability 1), and does not change the
row space of X1 . Hence, the signal intended for the dynamic
receiver can be decoded by the static receiver. After recovering
the subspace spanned by X 1 , the codeword itself is known as it
is the unique representation for this subspace in the codebook
X1 . Then, X1 is peeled off from the static signal:

(14)

where w2 is the equivalent noise. Since the static receiver
˜
knows h2 , it decodes x2 and attains the degrees of freedom 1
(thus 1/2 per time-slot).
Therefore, the proposed scheme attains the maximum 1/2
degrees of freedom for the dynamic receiver, which is the
maximum degrees of freedom available to it even if the static
receiver were absent. Meanwhile 1/2 degrees of freedom is
achieved for the static receiver without penalty to the dynamic
receiver. With time sharing between this scheme and D 2 , we
attain the degrees of freedom

(15)

where t ∈ [0, 1] is a time-sharing factor. Figure 2 shows that
this region is uniformly larger than that of the orthogonal
transmission.3
Remark 1: The key difference between the method proposed here and the method in [1] is as follows. The information
for the static receiver is carried by the exact value of x 2 ,
instead of its direction (subspace) as in the Grassmannian
superposition, i.e., the signal for the static receiver is carried
in the Euclidean space instead of the Grassmannian.

Because H2 is known by the static receiver, Eq. (18) represents an ordinary point-to-point MIMO channel, and therefore
N2 N1 degrees of freedom can be communicated via X 2 to
the static receiver (over T time-slots) [9].
Altogether, the Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition attains the degrees of freedom pair D
D=

N1 (1 − N1 /T ), N2 N1 /T .

(19)

More precisely, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1 (N1 ≤ N2 ): An M -antenna transmitter broadcasts to a dynamic receiver and a static receiver with N 1
and N2 antennas, respectively, where the coherence time
of the dynamic channel is T . The Grassmannian-Euclidean

consists of the convex hull of D 1 , D2 and D.
Proof: See Appendix I.

because the antenna conﬁguration does not allow to use the method in [1].

We plot the degrees of freedom region in Figure 3. For
relatively small T or large N 2 , the degrees of freedom gain
is signiﬁcant. For example, at T = 4, the proposed method
achieves a degrees of freedom 2 for the static receiver while
attaining the maximum degrees of freedom 1 for the dynamic
receiver. As T increases the gain over orthogonal transmission
decreases. In the limit T → ∞, we have ΔR 1 = O(1), and the
degrees of freedom gain of Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition goes away. The Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition
also provides signiﬁcant gain over the method in [1]

receiver can never exceed N 1 (1 − N1 /T ) (see Section II),
therefore, Grassmannian-Euclidean superposition achieves the
optimal degrees of freedom.
