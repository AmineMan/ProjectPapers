Abstract—We consider a fading AWGN 2-user 2-hop network
in which the channel coefﬁcients are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) drawn from a continuous distribution
and vary over time. For a broad class of channel distributions,
we characterize the ergodic sum capacity within a constant
number of bits/sec/Hz, independent of signal-to-noise ratio. The
achievability follows from the analysis of an interference neutralization scheme where the relays are partitioned into K pairs,
and interference is neutralized separately by each pair of relays.
For K = 1, we previously proved a gap of 4 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d.
uniform phase fading and approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d.
Rayleigh fading. In this paper, we give a result for general K. In
the limit of large K, we characterize the ergodic sum capacity
within 4((log π) − 1)
2.6 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. uniform phase
fading and 4(4 − log 3π)
3.1 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh
fading.

which is similar to ergodic interference alignment [5], [13]
applied for multi-source single-hop networks. Our previous
work [12] considered 2-user 2-hop networks assuming that
the number of relays L is equal to 2 and characterized the
ergodic sum capacity within 4 bits/sec/Hz for independently
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform phase fading and
approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. As
the number of relays L increases, the ergodic sum capacity
increases approximately as 2 log L and we can narrow the
corresponding gap in our analysis. We show that in the limits
of large L this gap is given by 4((log π) − 1)
2.6 for
i.i.d. uniform phase fading and 4(4 − log 3π) 3.1 for i.i.d.
Rayleigh fading.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In recent years, there has been signiﬁcant progress towards
understanding fundamentals of multi-source single-hop networks. Approximate capacity results have been proved for
the 2-user interference channel [1], many-to-one or one-tomany interference channel [2], and two-way channel [3],
which characterize the capacity within a constant number of
bits/sec/Hz independent of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
channel parameters. It has also been proved in [4] that interference alignment can achieve the optimal degrees of freedom
(DoF) of the time-varying K-user interference channel. The
recently proposed ergodic interference aliment in [5] makes
interference aligned at ﬁnite SNR.
For multi-source multi-hop networks, interference can be
cancelled by aligning multiple paths through the network, a
technique termed as interference neutralization. Proper use of
such interference neutralization is the key for an approximate
capacity [6] or DoF characterization [7]–[11] of multi-source
multi-hop networks. In spite of recent progress in this area,
the best known capacity characterization for fully connected
2-user 2-hop networks is within o(log(SNR)) bits/sec/Hz [8],
which can be arbitrarily large as SNR increases.
The aim of this paper is to close the capacity gap of the 2user 2-hop networks within a constant number of bits/sec/Hz,
independent of SNR and the number of relays. Our achievability is based on ergodic interference neutralization [9], [12],

A. Fading 2 × 2K × 2 Networks
We study a 2-user 2-hop network with 2K relays depicted in
Fig. 1 where each source wishes to transmit an independent
message to its destination. The input–output relation of the
ﬁrst hop at time t is given by
yR [t] = H[t]x[t] + zR [t],

of the relays at time t. Similarly, the input–output relation of
the second hop at time t is given by

t, xR [t] = [xR,1 [t], · · · , xR,2K [t]]T is the transmit signal
vector of the relays at time t, and z[t] = [z1 [t], z2 [t]]T is
the noise vector of the destinations at time t. Let Hk [t] =
[[h2k−1,1 [t], h2k−1,2 [t]]T , [h2k,1 [t], h2k,2 [t]]T ]T denote the 2 ×
2 dimensional channel matrix at time t from the sources to
relays 2k − 1 and 2k, where hi,j [t] is the (i, j)th element of
H[t]. Then H[t] = [H1 [t]T , · · · , HK [t]T ]T . Similarly, denote
Gk [t] = [[g1,2k−1 [t], g1,2k [t]]T , [g2,2k−1 [t], g2,2k [t]]T ]T and
G[t] = [G1 [t], · · · , GK [t]], where gj,i [t] denote the (j, i)th
element of G[t]. Each source and relay should satisfy the
average power constraint P and the elements of zR [t] and
z[t] are i.i.d. drawn from NC (0, 1).
We assume that channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d. drawn from a
continuous distribution f (x), x ∈ C, and vary independently
and identically over time. Without loss of generality, we
assume that E[|hi,j [t]|2 ] = 1 and E[|gj,i [t]|2 ] = 1 for all
i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2}. We further assume that
the sources do not know any channel state information (CSI)
and the relays and the destinations know global CSI. That is,
at time t, each relay and destination knows H[t] and G[t].

the channel coefﬁcients.1 Here γ =
1+2P and aki =
|h2(k−1)+j,j |2 + |h2(k−1)+i,j |2 , j = 3 − i.
Remark 1: Theorem 1 generalizes our previous result in
[12], which corresponds to the case where K = 1. Therefore
the proposed ergodic interference neutralization characterizes
Csum within 4 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and
approximately 4.7 bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading when
K = 1. We refer to [12] and also the full paper [14] in
preparation for the proof.
For convenience, let RIN denote the achievable sum rate
of Theorem 1. Since channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d., Csum
is upper bounded by the ergodic capacity of the multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) channel from the sources to
the relays, that is

B. Setup
Based on the network model, we consider a set of length-n
block codes. Let Wi be the message of source i uniformly
distributed over {1, · · · , 2nRi }, where Ri is the rate of source
i. A rate pair (R1 , R2 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a
sequence of (2nR1 , 2nR2 , n) codes such that the probabilities
of error for W1 and W2 converge to zero as n increases. The
sum capacity Csum is deﬁned as the maximum achievable
sum rate. In the rest of the paper, we will characterize an
approximate capacity on Csum for a broad class of channel
distributions including Rayleigh fading.

RMIMO := E log det(I + P HH† ) .

Example 1 (Sum rate: Rayleigh fading): Figure 2 plots
RMIMO and RIN for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading, i.e., f (x) follows
NC (0, 1). As shown in the ﬁgure, RMIMO − RIN decreases
as K increases. Apparently the proposed ergodic interference
neutralization can narrow the gap from Csum as the number
of relays increases.

III. M AIN R ESULTS
B. Approximate Capacity

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce our main results and
explain the proposed ergodic interference neutralization in the
next section.

In this subsection, we consider a class of channel distributions such that f (x) is only a function of its magnitude |x|.
That is, for a given channel amplitude, its phase is uniformly
distributed over [0, 2π) independent of the channel amplitude.
We derive an upper bound on the gap between the ergodic
sum capacity and the achievable lower bound in Theorem 1
in the limit of large K.

As pointed out in [9], [12], a simple amplify-and-forward
with an appropriate delay τ is enough to neutralize interference
at both destinations if G[t + τ ]H[t] approximately becomes a
diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal elements. In this paper,
we impose a block-wise interference neutralization condition
such that Gk [t + τ ]Hk [t] approximately becomes a diagonal
matrix for all k ∈ {1, · · · , K}. Then for each block k we
apply the same channel pairing proposed in [14]. Speciﬁcally,
for A = [[a1,1 , a1,2 ]T , [a2,1 , a2,2 ]T ]T ∈ C2×2 , deﬁne

Fig. 3. Gap from the sum capacity for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and i.i.d
Rayleigh fading.

In the following theorem, we ﬁrst characterize the sum
capacity gap for i.i.d. uniform phase fading.
Theorem 2: Consider the fading 2 × 2K × 2 network. If
hi,j [t] = exp(θi,j [t]), gj,i [t] = exp(ϕj,i [t]), and θi,j [t]
and ϕj,i [t] are uniformly distributed over [0, 2π) for all
i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2}, then

The relays amplify and forward yR [t] with appropriate delay
τ if Gk [t + τ ] is approximately given by F2 (Hk [t]) for all k.
For relaying, the ﬁrst and the second relays in the kth block
(relays 2k − 1 and 2k, respectively) amplify and forward with

the ampliﬁcation coefﬁcients γ |det(Hkk [t])| and −γ |det(Hkk [t])| ,

Example 2 (Gap as K → ∞: Uniform phase fading):
Figure 3 plots the gap RMIMO − RIN for i.i.d. uniform
phase fading with respect to K. As shown in the ﬁgure, the
gaps decrease as K increases and eventually converge to
4((log π) − 1) regardless of P , which was proved in Theorem
2. Therefore the proposed ergodic interference alignment
characterizes Csum within 4((log π) − 1) bits/sec/Hz in the
limit of large K. Compared to 4 bits/sec/Hz, the sum capacity
gap when K = 1 (Remark 1), the sum capacity gap can be
tightened as K increases.

appears in the numerator of Theorem 1. The term γ 2 k=1 aki
in the denominator of Theorem 1 is the additional noise due
to amplify-and-forward relaying. Lastly, since the probability
distributions for [H1 [t]T , · · · , HK [t]T ]T at the ﬁrst hop and
[F (H1 [t]), · · · , F (HK [t])] at the second hop are the same,
we can utilize almost all channel instances, which provides
Theorem 1.
Although ﬁnding a pair of channel instances having exact
prescribed values is impossible, such a pairing can be done
approximately by partitioning the channel space of each hop.
In the following two subsections, we ﬁrst explain channel
space partition and pairing and then explain the detailed
proposed scheme.

Theorem 3: Consider the fading 2 × 2K × 2 network. If
f (x) is only a function of |x|, then
lim {Csum − RIN } ≤ 4 − 4 log (E[| det(H1 )|]) .

K→∞

Example 3 (Gap as K → ∞: Rayleigh fading): Figure 3
plots RMIMO − RIN for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading with respect
to K. That is, f (x) follows NC (0, 1). It can be shown that
E[| det(H1 )|] = 3π/8 for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading and thus the
theoretical limit in Theorem 3 is 4(4 − log 3π)
3.1. As
shown in the ﬁgure, RMIMO − RIN quickly converges to the
theoretical limit as K increases. Considering that the sum
capacity gap is approximately given by 4.7 bits/sec/Hz when
K = 1 (Remark 1), the sum capacity gap can be tightened as
K increases.

B. Partitioning and Pairing of Channel Space

•

2K×2

We partition the channel space of each hop, i.e, C
space for the ﬁrst hop and C2×2K space for the second hop.
For M ∈ Z+ and ∆ > 0, deﬁne Q1 = A ∈ ∆(Z2K×2 +
Z2K×2 ) |re(ai,j )| ≤ ∆M, |im(ai,j )| ≤ ∆M for all i ∈
{1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈ {1, 2} , where ai,j denotes the (i, j)th
element of A and re(·) and im(·) denote the real and imaginary
parts of a complex number. Here, M and ∆ are related to the
number of quantization points and the quantization interval.
For a quantized channel matrix Q ∈ Q1 , deﬁne A1 (Q) =
A ∈ C2K×2 − ∆ ≤ re(ai,j ) − re(qi,j ) < ∆ and − ∆ ≤
2
2
2
im(ai,j ) − im(qi,j ) < ∆ for all i ∈ {1, · · · , 2K} and j ∈
2
{1, 2} , where ai,j and qi,j denote the (i, j)th element of
A and Q, respectively. We will use A1 (Q) for partitioning
the ﬁrst-hop channel space. Similarly, we can deﬁne Q2 and
A2 (Q) for the second hop.
Now consider the channel space pairing. For A ∈ C2K×2 ,
deﬁne F (A) = [F2 [A1 ], F2 [A2 ], · · · , F2 [AK ]], where A =
[AT , AT , · · · , AT ]T and the deﬁnition of F2 (·) is given by
1
2
K
(4). Note that F (Q) ∈ Q2 for any Q ∈ Q1 . The relays
will choose a certain time t2 and amplify and forward yR [t1 ]
such that H[t1 ] ∈ A1 (Q) and G[t2 ] ∈ A2 (F (Q)). Hence the
channel subspace A1 (Q) of the ﬁrst hop will be paired with
the channel subspace A2 (F (Q)) of the second hop.
Based on the channel space partition and pairing rule
described in this subsection, we propose ergodic interference
neutralization in the next subsection.

(Relaying) For all Q ∈ Q1 , the relays amplify and
forward their received signals that were received during
T1 (Q) using the time indices in T2 (F (Q)). Speciﬁcally,
the transmit signal vector of the relays is given by
xR [t2 ] = Γ(Q)yR [t1 ], where t1 ∈ T1 (Q), and t2 ∈
T2 (F (Q)). Here

(Decoding) The destinations decode their messages based
on their received signals for t ∈ {1, · · · , nB }.
Then we can set ∆ → 0 and M → ∞, which are functions
of nB , such that the rate in Theorem 1 is achievable. We refer
to the full paper [14] in preparation for the detailed proof of
Theorem 1 and also refer to the paper [12], which is the case
where K = 1.
•

V. A PPROXIMATE C APACITY C HARACTERIZATION
In this section, we prove Theorems 2 and 3. For N -user
2-hop networks with L relays, it was shown in [7] that
interference can be completely neutralized if L ≥ N (N −
1) + 1, which indicates that for 2 × L × 2 networks with
L ≥ 3 interference neutralization can be achieved without
channel pairing. However, maximizing the achievable sum rate
exploiting interference neutralization without channel pairing
presented in [15] is non-convex and, as a result, it is unclear
how to determine the sum rate gap from the cut-set upper
bound. By contrast, we now show that our achievable rate
expression from Theorem 1 permits to derive a ﬁnite-gap
result.
We ﬁrst introduce the following lemma, which will be used
to prove Theorems 2 and 3.

C. Block-wise Interference Neutralization
We ﬁrst divide a length-n block into B sub-blocks having
n
length nB = B each. We assume block transmission. At the
ﬁrst sub-block, the sources transmit their ﬁrst messages to the
relays (the relays do not transmit). At the bth sub-block, b ∈
{2, · · · , B − 1}, the sources transmit their bth messages to the
relays and the relays amplify and forward the received signals
of the (b − 1)th sub-block to the destinations. At the last subblock, the relays amplify and forward the received signals of
the (B − 1)th sub-block to the destinations (the sources do not
transmit). Hence, the number of effective sub-blocks is equal
to B − 1. Since we can set both nB and B as large as possible
1
as n increases, the fractional rate loss B becomes negligible as
n increases. For simplicity, we describe the proposed scheme
based on the ﬁrst message transmission and omit the sub-block
index.
For Q ∈ Q1 , denote T1 (Q) = t H[t] ∈ A1 (Q), t ∈
{1, · · · , nB } , which is the set of time indices of the ﬁrst hop
whose channel instances belong to A1 (Q). Similarly, for Q ∈
Q2 , denote T2 (Q) = t G[t] ∈ A2 (Q), t ∈ {1, · · · , nB } ,
which is the set of time indices of the second hop whose
channel instances belong to A2 (Q). The encoding, relaying,
and decoding are as follows.
• (Encoding) The sources transmit their messages using
Gaussian codebook with power P . Speciﬁcally, the transmit signal vector of the sources is given by x[t] with
E x[t]x[t]† = P I for t ∈ {1, · · · , nB }.

as m increases. This bound is tight in the limit of large m
since E log(1 + cSm 2 ) ≤ log(1 + c E[Sm 2 ]) from Jensen’s
