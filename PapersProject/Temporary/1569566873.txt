their linear measurements without having the knowledge of
the underlying structure? Does this ignorance incur a cost in
the sampling rate?
In algorithmic information theory, Kolmogorov complexity, introduced by Solomonoff [12], Kolmogorov [13], and
Chaitin [14], deﬁnes a universal notion of complexity for
ﬁnite-alphabet sequences. Given a ﬁnite-alphabet sequence
x, the Kolmogorov complexity of x, K(x), is deﬁned as the
length of the shortest computer program that prints x and
halts. In [15], extending the notion of Kolmogorov complexity to real-valued signals1 by their proper quantization, we
addressed some of the above questions. We introduced the
minimum complexity pursuit (MCP) algorithm for recovering “structured” signals from their linear measurements. We
showed that ﬁnding the “simplest” solution satisfying the
linear measurements recovers the signal using many fewer
measurements than its ambient dimension.
In this paper, we extend the results of [15] to the case
where the measurements are noisy. We ﬁrst propose an
updated version of MCP that takes into account that the
measurements are a linear transformation of the signal plus
Gaussian noise. We prove that the proposed algorithm is
stable with respect to the noise and derive bounds on its
reconstruction error in terms of the sampling rate and the
variance of the noise.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section II
deﬁnes the notation used throughout the paper. Section II-B
deﬁnes Kolmogorov information dimension of a real-valued
signal. Section III formally deﬁnes the MCP algorithm and
reviews and extends some of the related results proved in
[15]. Section IV considers the case of noisy measurements
and proves that MCP is stable. Section V mentions some of
the related work in the literature, and Section VI concludes
the paper. Appendix A presents two useful lemmas used in
the proofs.

Abstract— A host of problems involve the recovery of structured signals from a dimensionality reduced representation
such as a random projection; examples include sparse signals
(compressive sensing) and low-rank matrices (matrix completion). Given the wide range of different recovery algorithms
developed to date, it is natural to ask whether there exist
“universal” algorithms for recovering “structured” signals from
their linear projections. We recently answered this question in
the afﬁrmative in the noise-free setting. In this paper, we extend
our results to the case of noisy measurements.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Data compressors are ubiquitous in the digital world. They
are built based on the premise that text, images, videos,
etc. all are highly structured objects, and hence exploiting
those structures can dramatically reduce the number of bits
required for their storage. In recent years, a parallel trend has
been developing for sampling analog signals. There too, the
idea is that many analog signals of interest have some kind
of structure that enables considerably lowering the sampling
rate from the Shannon-Nyquist rate.
The ﬁrst structure that was extensively studied in this
context is sparsity. It has been observed that many natural signals have sparse representations in some domain.
The term compressed sensing (CS) refers to the process
of undersampling a high-dimensional sparse signal through
linear measurements and recovering it from those measurements using efﬁcient algorithms [1], [2]. Low-rankedness [3],
model-based compressed sensing [4]–[8], and ﬁnite rate of
innovation [9] are examples of some other structures that
have already been explored in the literature.
While in the original source coding problem introduced by
Shannon [10], the assumption was that the source distribution
is known both to the encoder and to the decoder, and hence
is used in the code design, it was later shown that this
information is not essential. In fact, universal compression
algorithms are able to code stationary ergodic processes at
their entropy rates, without knowing the source distribution
[11]. In other words, there exists a family of compression
codes that are able to code any stationary ergodic process at
its entropy rate asymptotically [11]. The same result holds
for universal lossy compression.
One can ask similar questions for the problem of undersampling “structured” signals: How to deﬁne the class
of “structured” signals? Are there sampling and recovery
algorithms for the reconstruction of “structured” signals from

B. Kolmogorov complexity
The Kolmogorov complexity of a ﬁnite-alphabet sequence
x with respect to a universal Turing machine U is deﬁned
as the length of the shortest program on U that prints x
and halts.2 Let K(x) denote the Kolmogorov complexity of
binary string x ∈ {0, 1}∗ ∪n≥1 {0, 1}n .
Deﬁnition 1: For real-valued x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈
[0, 1]n , deﬁne the Kolmogorov complexity of x at resolution
m as
K [·]m (x) = K([x1 ]m , [x2 ]m , . . . , [xn ]m ).
Deﬁnition 2: The Kolmogorov information dimension of

According to Corollary 1, if the complexity of the signal is
less than κ, then the number of linear measurements needed
for asymptotically perfect recovery is, roughly speaking, at
the order of κ log n. In other words, the number of measurements is proportional to the complexity of the signal and
only logarithmically proportional to its ambient dimension.

the following we consider several interesting corollaries that

The MCP algorithm proposed in [15] is mainly inspired
by [18] and [19]. Consider the universal denoising problem
where θ is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise as
X n = θ + Z n . The denoiser’s goal is to recover θ from the
noisy observation X n . The minimum Kolmogorov complexity
estimation (MKCE) approach proposed in [18] suggests
ˆ
a denoiser that looks for the sequence θ with minimum
Kolmogorov complexity among all the vectors that are within
some distance of the observation vector X n . [18] shows that
if θi are i.i.d., then under certain conditions, the average
ˆ
marginal conditional distribution of θi given Xi tends to the
actual posterior distribution of θ1 given X1 .
In [18], the authors consider the problem of recovering a
low-complexity sequence from its linear measurements. Let
S(k0 ) {xn ∈ [0, 1]n : K(xn ) ≤ k0 }. Consider measuring
d
xn ∈ S(k0 ) using a d×n binary matrix A. Let yo = Axn . To
o

n
d
ˆ
recover xo from measurements yo , [18] suggests ﬁnding xn
arg minxn : yo =Axn K(xn ), and proves that
as xn (yo , A)
ˆ d
d
if d ≥ 2k0 , then this algorithm is able to ﬁnd xn with high
o
probability. Clearly assuming that a real-valued sequence has
a low complexity is very restrictive, and hence S(k0 ) does
not include any of the classes that has been studied in CS
literature. For instance most of the one sparse signals have
inﬁnite Kolmogorov complexity, and hence the result of [18]
does not imply useful information.
In a recent and independent work, [20] and [21] consider a
scheme similar to MCP. For a stationary and ergodic source,
they propose an algorithm to approximate MCP. While the
empirical results are promising, no theoretical guarantees are
provided on either the performance of MCP or their ﬁnal
algorithm.
The notion of sparsity has already been generalized in
the literature in several different directions [3], [4], [9],
[22]. More recently, [22] introduced the class of simple
functions and atomic norm as a framework that uniﬁes some

of the above observations and extends them to some other
signal classes. While all these models can be considered as
subclasses of the general model considered in this paper,
it is worth noting that even though the recovery approach
proposed here is universal, given the incomputibility of
Kolmogorov complexity, it is not useful for practical purposes. Finding practical algorithms with provable performance guarantees is left for future research.
In this paper, we have focused on deterministic signal
models. For the case of random signals, [23] considers the
problem of recovering a memoryless process from its undersampled linear measurements and establishes a connection
between the required number of measurements and the Renyi
entropy of the source. Also, our work is in the same spirit
as the minimum entropy decoder proposed by Csiszar in
[24], which is a universal decoder, for reconstructing an i.i.d.
signal from its linear measurements.

In this paper, we have considered the problem of recovering structured signals from their random linear measurements. We have investigated the minimum complexity pursuit
(MCP) scheme. Our results conﬁrm that if the Kolmogorov
complexity of the signal is upper bounded by κ, then MCP
recovers the signal accurately from O(κ log n) random linear
measurements, which is much smaller than the ambient
dimension. In this paper, we have speciﬁcally proved that
MCP is stable, such that the 2 -norm of the reconstruction
error is proportional to the standard deviation of the noise.
