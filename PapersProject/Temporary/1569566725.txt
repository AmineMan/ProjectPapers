Abstract—We study private broadcasting of two messages to
two groups of users over reversely degraded parallel channels.
Group 1 has two users, both interested in a common message
whereas group 2 has only one user. The message for each group
of users needs to be kept conﬁdential from the other group.
We characterize the capacity region for a special degradation
structure of the channels and establish the optimality of a
superposition codebook where codewords of a secure productcodebook form the cloud centers and codewords of a secure
multicast codebook form the satellite codewords. An extension to
Gaussian channels with a sum-power constraint is also obtained,
where the optimality of Gaussian codebooks is established using
an extremal inequality.

with a natural pairwise upper bound which is known to be not
tight in general [6].
In this paper we propose a superposition coding technique
that combines the secure multicast and secure product codebook construction discussed above. In our setup of interest,
there are two groups of users. Group 1 consists of K users
and group 2 consists of one user. There are two messages, one
for each group and each message needs to be communicated to
all users in the respective group and secured from the users in
the other group. We refer to this setup as private broadcasting.
It has been studied previously in [10]–[12] when there is a
single user in each group (i.e., K = 1) and in reference [6]
for a special compound channel. We establish the optimality
of the superposition technique for the case when K = 2 and
when a particular degradation structure is assumed across the
parallel channels.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The wiretap channel problem [1], [2] is an information theoretic model for secure communication at the physical layer.
The compound-wiretap channel [3] model is an extension
of the standard wiretap channel model where the channels
of both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper belong
to a set of possible channels. This setup also models the
possibility of having multiple receivers in each of the two
groups. The secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel
remains open in general and only some special cases have
been resolved [3]–[9]. In particular, the secrecy capacity has
been resolved for the case of parallel independent channels
when either there are multiple legitimate receivers and one
eavesdropper [6] and when there are multiple eavesdroppers
and one legitimate receiver [5], [8]. In the former setup, the
capacity is achieved using a secure-multicast codebook, which
consists of independent wiretap codebooks on each of the links
that individually secure the message from an eavesdropper
on that link. An alternate construction that involves indirect
decoding is proposed for the case of two channels in [7]. In
the other extreme, i.e., when there are multiple eavesdroppers
and one legitimate receiver, a secure-product codebook construction is proposed in [5], [8] and shown to be optimal. A
key property of this construction is that the output codeword
on any given link is independent of the output codewords on
other links. In both these cases the secrecy capacity coincides

II. P ROBLEM S TATEMENT AND M AIN R ESULTS
Our setup involves two independent parallel channels, two
groups and three receivers. Receiver 1 and 2 belong to group
1 and observe output y1 = (y11 , y12 ) and y2 = (y21 , y22 ) respectively whereas receiver 3 belongs to group 2 and observes
the output symbol z = (z1 , z2 ). The channel input symbols are
x1 and x2 . Throughout this paper we additionally assume the
following degradation order
x1 → y11 → z1 → y21
x2 → y22 → z2 → y12

We intend to transmit message m1 to receiver 1 and 2 in group

structure in the codebook, it sufﬁces for each user in group
1 to treat the satellite codeword on the weaker channel as a

noisy version of the cloud center ui .
The result in Theorem 1 can be extended to the case
of Gaussian parallel channels. Consider a Gaussian Channel

Codebook – Channel 2

Fig. 1: Proposed Superposition Coding Scheme. The coden
n
words of the product code (u1 , u2 ) constitute cloud-centers
whereas the codewords of the multicast code constitute the
sattelite codewords.

III. T HEOREM 1: C ODING S CHEME
The coding scheme uses a product codebook for message
m2 in order to guarantee that it is decodable by the user in
group 2 and kept secure from all users in group 1. A multicast
code is used for message m1 in order to guarantee that it
is decodable by the users in group 1 and kept secure from
the single user in group 2. On each channel, a superposition
codebook is applied where the codeword of the product
codebook is a cloud center and the codeword of the multicast
codebook is the satellite codeword.
The construction of the product codebook C2 is as follows.
Consider the set M21 of all binary sequences of length
N21 = n(I(u1 ; z1 ) − ε) and the set M22 of all binary
sequences of length N22 = n(I(u2 ; z2 ) − ε). We partition
the cartesian product M21 × M22 into 2nR2 bins so that each
bin contains 2n(I(u1 ;z1 )+I(u2 ;z2 )−R2 ) elements of the productset. Each element m21 ∈ M21 is encoded using a codebook
C21 whose codewords are sampled i.i.d. from the distribution
pu1 (u1 ). The elements m22 ∈ M22 are encoded using a
codebook C22 whose elements are sampled i.i.d. from the
distribution pu2 (u2 ). Each message m2 ∈ [1, 2nR2 ] constitutes
the bin-index of our product codebook. An element (m21 , m22 )
is selected uniformly at random from the bin associated
n
n
with m2 . The corresponding codewords (u1 (m21 ), u2 (m22 ))
constitute the cloud center of the superposition codebooks on
each link. We note that by construction we have that each
element (m21 , m22 ) is equally likely and,

imposed on the input symbols.
Theorem 2: The capacity region for private broadcasting

For each codeword sequence u1 ∈ C21 , we generate coden

sampled i.i.d. from the conditional distribution px1 |u1 (x1i |u1i ).

In an analogous manner, for each u2 ∈ C22 , we generate
n
a codebook C12 (u2 ) consisting of a total of 2nR1 bins and
2n(I(x2 ;z2 |u2 )+ε) codewords. Each codeword is sampled i.i.d.
from the conditional distribution px2 |u2 (x2i |u2i ).

Given a message m1 and a sequence pair (u1 , u2 ) we

select a codeword pair (x1 , x2 ) uniformly at random from the

respectively. Receiver 1 in group 1 searches for a codeword
n
n
n
pair (x1 , u1 , y11 ) that are jointly typical. This succeeds with
high probability since our choice of R1 guarantees that the
total number of codewords in the satellite codebook is no
greater than 2nI(x1 ;y11 ) . In turn the receiver decodes m1 with
high probability. Likewise user 2 in group 1 can decode
n
m1 with high probability using the output y22 . Similarly by
construction of C21 and C22 , user 2 can decode sub-messages
m21 and m22 with high probability and in turn ﬁnd the
corresponding message m2 .

mutually independent (c.f. (15)) and hence the knowledge of
n
(m21 , y11 ) do not help user 1 in group 1 to decode m22 .
To lower bound the ﬁrst term observe that from the symmetry of code construction

and since m22 ∈ [1, 2n(I(u2 ;z2 )−ε) ], and for each u2 (m22 ) a
nI(x2 ;z2 |u2 )
sequences are sampled in C12 in the bin
total of 2
m1 = 1 it follows from the analysis of a random wiretap
code [13, Remark 22.2, pp. 555] that
1
n
H(m22 |m1 = 1, y12 , C) ≥ I(u2 ; z2 ) − I(u2 ; y12 )

To bound the second term we note that from symmetry

n
Furthermore in the product code construction, for each m21 ∈
M21 there are a total of |M22 | = 2n(I(u2 ;z2 )−ε) possible
values for m22 . Due to random partitioning, which high probability the number of sequences in the bin with m2 = 1 is atmost |M22 |·2−n(R2 −ε) . Since R2 < I(u2 ; z2 )−I(u2 ; y22 )−2ε
it can be shown along the lines of [13, Lemma 22.1, pp. 554]
that

where C denotes the particular codebook selected in the
ensemble. Note that from (15) the messages (m21 , m22 ) are
mutually independent. From this it can be shown that outputs
n n
(z1 , z2 ) are conditionally independent given m1 . Thus we
have,

H(m22 |m2 = 1, m21 , m1 = 1, y1 , C)

analysis we can show that n I(m1 ; zj ) ≤ εn /2. Thus (16)
follows.

users in group 1 we show that provided R2 satisﬁes (7) we
have that

Consider the case when j = 1.

(27)

Substituting (27) and (25) into (23) we recover (20) for j = 1.
The result for j = 2 can be established in a similar fashion.
IV. T HEOREM 1: C ONVERSE
The intuition behind the converse is the following. Suppose
we are not required to transmit any information to receiver 2
in group 1. Furthermore suppose that we are also not required
to secure message m2 from user 1 in group 1. We only need to
send message m1 to receiver 1 while securing it from receiver
3 in group 2 and transmit m2 while only securing it against
user 2 in group 1. Looking at the degradation order on channel
2, it is apparent that no information must be transmitted on
channel 2. Once we restrict our attention to channel 1 we have
a degraded broadcast channel x1 → y11 → z1 → y21 where
the message m1 needs to be protected from the two weaker
receivers whereas the message m2 needs to be only protected
from the weakest receiver. For this simpliﬁed problem we
show that

R2 ≤ I(u1 ; z1 |y21 ).

(28)

Similarly by relaxing symmetric constraints on message transmission and secrecy we obtain the the remaining two constraints. A formal proof is discussed next.
Consider a sequence of codes indexed by the length n that
satisfy (3), as well as the Fano Inequality

The achievability follows by selecting a Gaussian input
distribution in Theorem 1. In particular let x1 ∼ N (0, P1 )
and x2 ∼ N (0, P2 ). Furthermore let u1 ∼ N (0, P21 ) and
u2 ∼ N (0, P22 ). Let x1 = x11 + u1 , where x11 ∼ N (0, P11 )
is independent of u1 and similarly let x2 = x12 + u2 where
x12 ∼ N (0, P12 ) is independent of u2 . Evaluating

which follows by substituting (3) and (29).
We use the following upper bound on the rate R1 ,

Gaussian channels we use an extremal inequality to establish

derived for a special channel model, we expect the coding
techniques to naturally generalize for multiple channels with
arbitrary number of users in group 1 and a single user in group
2. Such an extension will be reported elsewhere.

The last step follows from the worst-case additive noise
lemma. For the lower bound, note that since u1 → x → z1
holds and n1 is independent of these random variables we have
I(z1 ; n1 |u1 ) ≤ I(z1 ; n1 |x) = I(n1 + w1 ; n1 ) =

Hence for some 0 ≤ P11 ≤ P1 we have that

Upon substituting (60) into (54) we establish (11). To establish

from which we recover (13) by deﬁning P21 = P1 − P11 . The
upper bounds on R12 and R22 can be established in a similar
fashion and will be skipped.
VI. C ONCLUSION
We study the problem of secure broadcasting of two messages to two groups of users over two independent and parallel
channels. Group 1 has two receivers, both interested in a
common message, whereas group 2 has only one receivers.
Each message must be kept secure from user(s) in the other
group. For a particular degradation structure we establish the
optimality of a technique that combines a product code and a
multicast code using a superposition codebook. For the case of
