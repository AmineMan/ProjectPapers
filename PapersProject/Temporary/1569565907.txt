Abstract—In this paper we study the degraded broadcast
channel with action dependent states and causal side
information at the encoder. Two main models are studied:
the case where the actions depend only on the messages,
and the case where the actions can depend also on past
values of the state. The latter model is referred to as
actions with feedback. When the actions depend only
on the messages, the full capacity region is derived. We
then show that if the channel is physically degraded, then
dependence of the actions on past values of the state does
not increase its capacity region. We further demonstrate by
an example that if the channel is stochastically degraded,
action feedback can increase its capacity region. This
situation resembles previous results on feedback in regular
(state-independent) broadcast channels.
Index Terms—Action-dependent states; broadcast channel; causal side information; feedback; Shannon strategies.

alphabet, S the state space, PS|A a conditional PMF from
the action alphabet to the state space, X the channel
input alphabet, Y and Z the channel output alphabets,
and PY,Z|S,X a conditional PMF from S × X to Y × Z .
As a shorthand, and when the choice of the alphabets
and PS|A is clear, we will refer to the broadcast channel
just as PY,Z|S,X . Both the channel from action to state
and that from state and channel input to channel outputs
are assumed memoryless.
For notational convenience, the dimension in the PMF
notation will sometimes be omitted. Thus PS n |An (sn |an )
and PY n ,Z n |S n ,X n (y n , z n |sn , xn ) will be denoted by
PS|A (s|a) and PY,Z|S,X (y, z|s, x), respectively, and
similarly for other tuples.
As in [6], we consider a vector cost function, of
dimension d ≥ 1, that takes into account input and action
costs. Thus, let

Random variables are written by capital letters, with
similar convention for random vectors: An , Yij , A etc.
For two jointly distributed random variables A and
S , we denote by PA , PA,S , and PS|A the probability

are two integers. A coding scheme for the broadcast
channel with action dependent states available causally
at the encoder operates as follows. A vector of actions
An = α(M1 , M2 ) is selected by the encoder based on
the messages M1 and M2 which are drawn randomly
from N1 and N2 , respectively. A random state vector
S n is now generated as the output of the memoryless
channel PS|A with the action sequence An at its input.
The encoder observes the state sequence in a causal
manner and selects the channel input based on it and

We use in the sequel the notion of degradedness as
deﬁned in [5]. A broadcast channel PY,Z|S,X is said to
be physically degraded if there exists a conditional PMF

where no actions are present [5], the capacity of the
degraded broadcast channel with action-dependent states
depends on the conditional PMF PY,Z|S,X only via its
marginals PY |S,X and PZ|S,X . Therefore, no distinction has to be made between physically degraded and
stochastically degraded channels, and they will be termed
degraded broadcast channels.

the random mapping φ2 (U, K, ·) as T . For ﬁxed k , a
conditional distribution PU |K (·|k) induces a conditional
distribution on T , PT |K (·|k). By (9), and the fact the
T is a deterministic function of (K, U ), the following
Markov relations hold

since, on one hand, I(U ; Y |K) ≤ I(U, A; Y |K), and
on the other hand, we can always deﬁne a new external
˜
random variable U = (U, A), which satisﬁes (9) and
reduces (11) to (10a). The next proposition states a few

where (a) is true because T is a deterministic function of
(U, K), and (b) holds due to (13). This proves (14). Since
A and T are deterministic functions of (U, K), (14)
implies

The proof is given in Section IV. Due to space considerations, we will give only the proof of the converse part.
We note here that this result was derived independently
in [1].
It is possible to express Rc in terms of Shannon
strategies [4], as was done in [5, eq. (33)], with the
difference that in the current setting we have to take the
random actions A into account. Denote by T the family
of all Shannon strategies, i.e., mappings from S to X :

I(U ; Y |K) = I(U, A, T ; Y |K) = I(A, T ; Y |K)
= I(V ; Y |K)

(16)

where we identiﬁed V as the random extended strategy
(A, T ). Therefore, Rc can be characterized also as the
set of all costs-rates triples (λ, R1 , R2 ) satisfying
R1 ≤ I(V ; Y |K)

We denote by T a random mapping taking values in T ,
and PT its distribution. Let V be the set of all extended
strategies deﬁned as pairs (a, t) with a ∈ A and t ∈ T ,
and let PV be a distribution on V . That is, V is a random
extended strategy V = (A, T ).
We will now hinge on Proposition 1 and (11) to
characterize Rc in terms of extended strategies. Due to
Proposition 1 we can write

(17a)

R2 ≤ I(K; Z)

T = {t|t : S → X } .

(17b)

E [Λk (A, X)] ≤ λk ,

k = 1, 2, . . . , d

(17c)

where V is an extended strategy, and S and K are
independent given V .
III. ACTIONS WITH FEEDBACK
A natural extension of the model of Section II is the
case where the actions chosen by the encoder depend
not only on the messages, but also on past values of the
generated state, that is, Ai = Ai (M1 , M2 , S i−1 ). This
model is interpreted as actions with feedback from the
state sequence to the actions encoder. It is shown in [6]

A = φ1 (K, U )
˜
˜
X = φ2 (A, K, U, S) = φ2 (φ1 (K, U ), K, U, S)
= φ2 (K, U, S)

If the channel is not physically degraded, then allowing the actions to depend on past values of the state can
increase the capacity region. This is demonstrated in the
next example, which follows Dueck’s example [2].

that for the single user channel with action dependent
states known causally at the encoder, feedback from the
states does not increase capacity. The same question for
the non-causal case remains open.
In [3] El Gamal proved that the capacity region of
the memoryless physically degraded broadcast channel
is not enlarged by feedback. Dueck [2] demonstrated,
via examples, that partial (i.e., one sided) feedback can
increase the capacity regions of two-way channels and
general broadcast channels. Speciﬁcally, the example
that Dueck constructed for the broadcast channel is
a stochastically degraded one, thus emphasizing that
when feedback is present one has to distinguish between
physically and stochastically degraded models.
In this section we examine the broadcast channel with
causal side information and actions feedback. We show
that for this class of channels, the situation is parallel
to the case of regular broadcast channels with feedback:
dependence of the actions on past values of the state does
not increase the capacity region of degraded broadcast
channels, but it can increase the capacity region of
a stochastically degraded (and hence also the general)
broadcast channel. The deﬁnition of an (n, ν1 , ν2 , λ, )
code remains as in Deﬁnition 1, except that the action
mapping (1) is replaced by a sequence of mappings:
αi : N1 × N2 × S i−1 → A,

Example 1. We ﬁrst deﬁne the channel from the actions
to the state. Let A = A0 × A1 × A2 and S = S0 × S1 ,
where Ai = Sj = {0, 1} for i = 0, 1, 2 and j = 0, 1. Let
V be a binary (1/2, 1/2) random variable, independent
of the actions. The state S is deﬁned as:
S = (S0 , S1 ),

S1 = A1 + V.

(22)

The channel outputs Y and Z are given by:
Y = (Y0 , Y1 ),

Y0 = S0 ,

Z = (Z0 , Z1 ),

Y1 = S1 ,

Z0 = S0 ,

Z1 = A2 + V. (23)

Both outputs, Y and Z , are independent of X . Moreover,
since Z0 = Y0 and V is binary (1/2, 1/2), the output
Z is stochastically degraded with respect to Y . Since
the outputs are independent of the input, messages are
encoded only via the actions. Therefore the actions play
the role of the input in a broadcast channel without
states or actions. By (22) and (23), there is one noiseless
channel from the action A0 to the outputs (Y0 , Z0 ). The
channels from A1 to Y1 , and from A2 to Z1 , are useless
in the absence of state feedback, and the sum rate cannot
exceed 1. However, when the actions depend on past
values of S = (S0 , S1 ), at time i the encoder learns
Vi from S1,i and sends it to both receivers via A0,i+1
in the next time epoch. This results in two clean binary
channels, and the point (R1 , R2 ) = (1, 1) is achievable.

(18)

the costs (3) now depend on the state also via the actions
A:
E [Λk (A(S, M1 , M2 ), f (S, M1 , M2 ))] ≤ λk ,
k = 1, 2, . . . , d,

IV. P ROOF OF THE CONVERSE PART OF T HEOREM 1

(20)
We start with a sequence of codes with increasing
blocklength and vanishing probability of error. Denote by
M1 and M2 the messages intended to user Y and user
Z , respectively. To prove the converse of Theorem 1,
we can assume that the channel is physically degraded.
Starting from the Fano inequality, we have

where we use the notation
α(s, m1 , m2 ) = (α1 (m1 , m2 ), α2 (s1 , m1 , m2 ),
α3 (s2 , m1 , m2 ), . . . , αn (sn−1 , m1 , m2 ) .

(21)

We have the following result
Theorem 2. The capacity region of the physically degraded broadcast channel with action-dependent states
known causally at the encoder is not increased if the
actions depend on past values of the states.
