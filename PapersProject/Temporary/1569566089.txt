Abstract—In this work, we consider the power spectrum of
error-control codes designed for the reader-to-tag channel in nearﬁeld passive radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) systems using
inductive coupling as a power transfer mechanism. In contrast to
previous works, binary phase-shift keying is considered, and the
power spectral density is computed for two of the codes (and one
runlength constraint) considered in a recent paper by Barbero
et al. (Inf. Theory Appl., San Diego, CA, 2011), and for two new
codes introduced in this paper. Furthermore, we compute the
total power transferred to the tag as a function of the inter-coil
separation for different codes (and one runlength constraint).

Inductive coupling is a technique by which energy from one
circuit is transferred to another without wires. Simultaneously,
the energy transfer can be used as a vehicle for information
transmission. This is a fundamental technology for near-ﬁeld
passive radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) applications as
well as lightweight sensor applications. In the passive RFID
application, a reader, containing or attached to a power source,
controls and powers a communication session with a tag;
a device without a separate power source. The purpose of
the communication session may be, for examples, object
identiﬁcation, access control, or acquisition of sensor data.
A simpliﬁed view of the reader-to-tag channel can be seen
in Fig. 1. In more detail, an information source generates k bits
of information u = (u1 , . . . , uk ), which are passed through an
encoder to produce an encoded frame c = (c1 , . . . , cn ). The
encoded frame is interpreted as a waveform that modulates a
carrier wave [1]. At the receiver (or tag) side, the demodulator
in the tag samples the physical waveform at time intervals
determined by the tag’s timing device, and converts it into an
ˆ
estimate c = (ˆ1 , . . . , cn ) of the transmitted frame, where in
c
ˆ
general n = n. A decoder at the tag subsequently attempts
ˆ
ˆ
to recover an estimate u = (ˆ1 , . . . , uk ) of u from c. In
u
ˆ
the literature, different channel models have been proposed
to incorporate the effects of timing errors in the readerto-tag channel. In particular, in [2], a bit-shift model was
introduced, and later in [3] a discretized Gaussian shift model
was proposed. In both papers, simple modulation codes with

some error-correcting/avoiding properties were constructed as
well. The capacity of the discretized Gaussian shift channel
from [3] was considered in [4].
In [5], wireless information and power transfer across a
noisy inductively coupled channel was considered from a
different perspective, i.e., it was not considered from the
perspective of timing errors and code design, but from a circuit
perspective. In particular, the power transfer efﬁciency function, deﬁned as the fraction of the total available power and the
delivered power as a function of frequency, has a peak around
a speciﬁc frequency (depending on the circuit parameters).
Thus, to transfer as much power as possible, we could transmit
a single sinusoid at the frequency that maximizes the power
transfer efﬁciency function. Obviously, such a strategy will
not work from the perspective of information transfer, since
a sinusoid of a ﬁxed frequency has zero bandwidth and will
therefore provide zero communication rate.
In this work, we will compute the power spectral density
of two of the codes (and one runlength constraint) from [3]
and look into their suitability from the perspective provided in
[5], i.e., are they good for power transfer? Two new codes are
also presented. We remark that the codes (and the runlength
constraints) in [2], [3] were also designed considering power
transfer. In particular, the codes were designed to be unbalanced, i.e., there will be more ones than zeros in the encoded

sequences. The rationale behind this construction principle
was the fact that amplitude modulation was assumed. Thus,
a one (resp. a zero) was transmitted by the presence (resp.
absence, or alternatively a low amplitude) of the carrier for the
duration speciﬁed for transmitting that particular bit. In this
work, however, we will abandon this restriction and consider
traditional binary phase-shift keying (BPSK).

3) Perform state merging to simplify the resulting state
diagram. State merging of two states can be performed
if the output edge structure is identical.
4) Transform the state diagram into a runlength state diagram by removing all states with the property that the
incoming bit (which is the same on all incoming edges)
and the outgoing bit (which is also the same on all
outgoing edges) are the same. For details, see [6] or
Example 1 below.
Now, from [6, Theorem 1], it follows that

II. P RELIMINARIES
Let {bi } denote a binary sequence, and let Ai = 1 − 2bi .
The sequence {Ai } is the BPSK-modulated version of {bi }.
In the following, we assume that the sequence {Ai } is widesense-stationary. The spectrum (in the D-domain) of a widesense-stationary (discrete-time) process {Ai } is

SX (D) =
p(1)π (I + G(D))

where E[·] denotes statistical expectation. To compute the
√
power spectral density, we use D = ej2πf T , where j = −1,
f is the frequency, and T is the symbol period. Now, when
signaling with the pulse shape PT (t) where

where u = (1, 1, . . . , 1), (·)T is the transpose of its argument,
I is the L × L identity matrix, L is the number of states in
the runlength state diagram, π = (π1 , . . . , πL ) is the solution
−1
to πG(1) = π, p(1) = πG (1)uT
, and G (D) is the
element-wise derivative of G(D) with respect to D.
The existence of discrete components in the power spectrum
deserves special attention. In fact, the existence of discrete
components is closely related to the roots of the polynomial
det(I + G(D)) [6]. In particular, if this polynomial has roots
on the unit circle there will be discrete components in the
power spectrum. For details, we refer the interested reader to
[6]. See also [8].

III. RUNLENGTH L IMITATIONS

In a recent paper [3], different constraints on the encoded
sequence were proposed. These constraints were constructed
to improve the error-rate performance on a discretized Gaussian shift channel. In particular, a speciﬁc binary runlength
limitation denoted by RLL(L0 , L1 ), where Lb is the set of
admissible runlengths of binary symbol b, was introduced. In
the rest of this section, we will consider two of the codes (and
one runlength constraint) from [3], as well as two new codes
(in Examples 3 and 4), through a series of examples organized
into three subsections.

Also, in [6], a procedure to compute the power spectrum
of a runlength limited code (under BPSK modulation) was
outlined. In particular, the power spectral density in (1) can
be computed using a process {Xi } deﬁned by Xi = 1/2 ·
(Ai − Ai−1 ). The relationship between SX (D) and SA (D) is
SA (D) =

In this subsection, we consider a three-state, rate-1/2 code
from [3] and the Manchester code (also considered in [3]) in
more detail.

which follows directly from the deﬁnition of the sequence
{Xi }. In Theorem 1 in [6], a formula is given to compute
SX (D) based on the one-step transition matrix G(D) of a
runlength state diagram of the code that generates the binary
sequence {bi }. In [6], the codes are used in differential mode,
and thus the procedure for generating the runlength state
diagram is different from the procedure that we will use in
this paper. In particular, if the code under consideration can
be described by a state diagram, the procedure to construct a
corresponding runlength state diagram is as follows:
1) Insert intermediate states such that each edge is labeled
by a single bit.
2) Perform state splitting such that all edges coming into
(resp. leaving) a given state have the same label. Such
a state diagram is called a destined state diagram [7].

Example 1. A three-state, rate-1/2 encoder for a
RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constrained code (taken from Example 3
in [3]) is depicted in Fig. 2. The corresponding runlength
state diagram (constructed using the procedure above) is
given in Fig. 3(d), and the one-step transition matrix is

the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constraint. See Example 3 in [3] for

balanced.

single bit. In Fig. 3(b), several states have been split in order
to have all incoming and outgoing edges labeled with the

state diagram in Fig. 3(b) by merging the states labeled “E”
and “F”. Finally, in Fig. 3(d), the resulting runlength state
diagram is depicted. For the one-step transition matrix in (4),

The RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constraint has capacity larger than
1/2 [3]. Thus, we can use some of the capacity gap to
impose an extra condition on the output sequences. The
RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constraint with the additional constraint
that the running digital sum (i.e., the absolute value of the
number of ones minus the number of zeros) is limited to 3 has
a capacity of only 0.478, so we can not ﬁnd a rate-1/2 encoder for such a constraint. However, the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})constraint with the additional constraint that the running digital
sum is limited to 5 has a capacity larger than 1/2. Thus, it
should be possible to ﬁnd a rate-1/2 encoder. This constraint
and the corresponding encoders will also have a spectral null
at f = 0, i.e., they will be dc-free. Such a code has been
designed and is given in Example 4 below.

IV. P OWER T RANSFER TO THE TAG
In this section, we consider the total power transferred from
the reader to the tag. We use the model proposed in [5], where
the channel transfer function (in the Fourier domain) is given
by
j2πf M
H(f ) =
j2πf L2 (1 + j2πf rl cl ) + rl
where f is the frequency, M is the mutual inductance between
the reader and the tag, and rl , cl , and L2 are the load
(i.e., on the tag side) resistance, capacitance, and inductance,
respectively. See Equation (20) in [5] for details. Furthermore,
in [1], it was shown that the mutual inductance M decreases
as a function of the inter-coil separation. See Equation (11)
in [1] for details. Thus, using the expressions for the power
spectral density of the codes (or constraint) from the examples
above, we can compute the total power transferred to the tag,
denoted by Ptransfer , as a function of the inter-coil separation.
In more detail,

C. The RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-Constraint From [3]
In this subsection, we will consider the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})constraint from [3] in more detail in Example 5 below.
Example 5. Without loss of generality, let α denote the
combined probability of a runlength of a single one or a
single zero, from which it follows that 1 − α is the combined
probability of a runlength of three ones or zeros. In this case,
the runlength state diagram consists of a single state, and the
corresponding one-step transition matrix is

where the dependency of the power spectral density on T has
been made explicit. Here, Topt is the optimal value for T , i.e.,
the value that maximizes the power transferred. In general, the
value of Topt will depend on the code (or constraint) and give
different transmission rates for different codes (or constraints).
Since M is a function of the inter-coil separation, we can
plot Ptransfer as a function of this parameter. Note that since
different values of M will correspond to a different scaling
of the function H(f ), Topt will not depend on the inter-coil
separation.

G(D) = αD + (1 − α)D3

V. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
In Fig. 5, we have plotted the continuous part of the power
spectral density SV (f ) as a function of the frequency f for
the different codes from Examples 1 through 4. Also, for
comparison purposes, we have plotted the power spectrum of
the MFM/Miller code taken from [6]. For all curves, we have
used the same value of T = 1, which keeps R/T the same
for all curves, since all codes have the same rate of 1/2.
In Fig. 6, we have plotted the total power transferred to
the tag (according to the discussion in Section IV) for the
different codes from Examples 1 through 4 as a function of
the inter-coil separation. In particular, rl = 104 , cl = 2.76 ·
10−10 , and L2 = 5 · 10−7 . With these parameters, Topt = 1.7 ·
10−8 , 3.3 · 10−8 , 1.9 · 10−8 , and 1.5 · 10−8 , for the codes from
Examples 1 through 4, respectively. The mutual inductance
as a function of the inter-coil separation is taken from Fig.
6 in [1]. Note that the Manchester code has the best power
transfer, but the lowest transmission rate and does not provide
any error-correction on the discretized Gaussian shift channel.
In general, from the ﬁgure, we observe a trade-off between
transmission rate and power transfer. For instance, among the
three RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})-constrained codes, the 12-state code
has the highest transmission rate, but inferior power transfer
compared to the three-state code.
For comparison, in Fig. 6, we have also plotted the total
power transferred to the tag for the RLL({1, 3}, {1, 3})constraint of Example 5 (with α = 0.64) as a function of
the inter-coil separation. The choice of α = 0.64 is to have
a fair comparison (the three-state code of Example 1 gives
α = 0.64 for long random code sequences). The corresponding
value for Topt is 1.5 · 10−8 , which is the same as for the 12state code (with one digit precision), but the constraint gives
a higher power transfer, which means that codes achieving a
better trade-off between transmission rate and power transfer
could potentially be designed.
