such nonlinear communication channels are derived in this
paper, based on some reﬁned versions of the Azuma-Hoeffding
inequality from [7], [8] and [9] which provide improvements
over the exponential martingale inequalities that were used
in [6]. The resulting new expressions of achievable rates
are exempliﬁed in this work for linear and non-linear timeinvariant channel models.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II provides new
bounds on the error probability and achievable rates under
ML decoding. These bounds are exempliﬁed in Section III to
time-invariant linear channels with memory and memoryless
non-linear channels. These comparisons show a signiﬁcant improvement over the results reported in [6]. Finally, Section IV
concludes our discussion.

Abstract—This paper establishes new achievable rates for nonlinear Volterra communication channels using reﬁned versions
of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. The characteristics of these
rates are illuminated in special cases of interest that include timeinvariant linear channels with memory, memoryless non-linear
channels, and Volterra channel models.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Nonlinear effects are typically encountered in wireless communication systems and optical ﬁbers, which degrade the quality of the information transmission. In satellite communication
systems, the ampliﬁers located on board satellites typically
operate at or near the saturation region in order to conserve
energy. Saturation nonlinearities of ampliﬁers introduce nonlinear distortion in the transmitted signals. Similarly, power
ampliﬁers in mobile terminals are designed to operate in a nonlinear region in order to obtain high power efﬁciency in mobile
cellular communications. In optical ﬁbers [1], dispersion noise
and nonlinearities need to be overcome with advanced signal
processing techniques. Nonlinear communication channels can
be represented by Volterra models [2, Chapter 14]. Analytical
foundations of the Volterra series operator were presented in
[3]. The optical ﬁber channel has been alternately studied by
Poisson type models in [4].
Random coding theorems (see, e.g, [5, Chapter 5.5] constitute critical performance measures of coded information
transmission since they describe the exponential behavior of
the decoding error probability. The main difﬁculty in the
derivation of calculable closed-form upper bounds on the
average decoding error probability when transmission takes
place over non-linear channels stems mainly from the difﬁculty
of obtaining the channel output probability density function.
Previous work on the analysis of coded communication for
Volterra channel models is presented, e.g., in [2, Chapter 14.5]
and references therein.
Error probability bounds and achievable rates for Volterra
channel models were recently developed in [6] using exponential martingale inequalities. Improved achievable rates for

II. N EW B OUNDS ON THE E RROR P ROBABILITY AND
ACHIEVABLE R ATES UNDER ML D ECODING
Under the random coding setup in [5, Section 5.5], consider
an ensemble of block codes C where N is the block length,
and R is the code rate in nats per channel use. The codewords
of a codebook from this ensemble are assumed to be selected
independently, and the symbols in each codeword are also
assumed to be i.i.d. with an arbitrary probability assignment
Q. Let M = exp(N R) be the cardinality of the considered
codebook C from the ensemble C. Assume that the relation
between the transmitted codeword u = (u1 , . . . , uN ) ∈ C and
the discrete-time channel output y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) is given by
the equality
y = Du + ν

(1)

where ν = (ν1 , . . . , νN ) is an additive channel noise vector,
and D denotes an operator describing the (linear or nonlinear) communication channel without the additive noise. The
Volterra operator D of order L and memory q is characterized
by the equality (see [6, Eq. (4)])

Under the above analysis, one can calculate the achievable rate
provided by (16) for several values of m and compare it with
the one provided by (17) where m = 2. More speciﬁcally, the
achievable rate (16) is expressed in terms of SNR, and it gets
the form:

(20)

Remark 3: According to [9, Proposition 2], the achievable

rate R2 (σν ) in (18) is larger than R1 (σν ) in (17).
Remark 4: Following the discussion in [9, Section III.C.1],
a closed form expression for the maximal value of ρ in (17)
leads to the bound in [9, Corollary 4] (see the proof in [9,
Appendix C]).

Remark 5: Both R1 (σν ) and R2 (σν ) are continuous functions of Q and ρ. Their maxima are attained since Q and ρ

u + ν, ν ∼ N (0, σν ), the parameters Dv (Q), d and γ2 deﬁned
in (5), (8), (9) and (11) can be calculated analytically. For the

Figure 1 illustrates that all achievable rates provided in this

that R1 (SNR) converges fast as m grows. Furthermore,
(6)
the achievable rate R1 (SNR) approximates very well the
achievable rate R2 (SNR) provided in (23), and both of them
are very close to the capacity of the binary-input additive white

New achievable rates for random coding are derived in
this work for non-linear communication channels. Exponential
martingale inequalities are properly utilized for this purpose.
The achievable rates obtained in this work improve previous
results obtained for the same channel models in [6]. This
improvement is facilitated by the use of some reﬁned versions
of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality that were introduced in
[8], [10], and more recently in [9]. The analysis presented
here can easily be extended to the case where the noise is
a complex Gaussian or circularly complex Gaussian, and the
parameters of the Volterra system are complex valued as it is
in the Volterra representation of bandpass nonlinear channels
[2, Section 14.3].

E. General Volterra Channel Models
From the previous analysis it follows that in the case of more
complex Volterra systems, it is preferable to select γ2 = 1.

Then the achievable rate R2 (σν ) (20) admits a closed-form
solution according to the analysis. The upper bound (18) on

representation of nonlinear narrow-band communication channels. Due to complexity of the channel model, the calculation
of the achievable rates provided by (17), (18) requires the
numerical calculation of the parameters d and σ 2 and thus
of γ2 for the martingale {Zi , Fi }N . In order to achieve this
i=0
goal, we have to calculate |Zi −Zi−1 | and Var(Zi |Fi−1 ) for all
possible combinations of the input samples which contribute to
the aforementioned expressions. Thus, the analytic calculation
of d and γl increases as the system’s memory q increases.
Numerical results are provided in Figure 2 for the case

and R2 (D1 , A, σν ) of (17) and (18), which depend on the
channel input parameter A, are compared to the achievable
rate provided in [6, Fig.2] and shown to be larger than the
latter.
