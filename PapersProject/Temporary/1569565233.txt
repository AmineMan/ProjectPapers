Abstract—An important practical open question has been to
design explicit, structured optical receivers that achieve the
Holevo limit in the contexts of optical communication and
“quantum reading.” The Holevo limit is an achievable rate that
is higher than the Shannon limit of any known optical receiver.
We demonstrate how a sequential decoding approach can achieve
the Holevo limit for both of these settings. A crucial part of our
scheme for both settings is a non-destructive “vacuum-or-not”
measurement that projects an n-symbol modulated codeword
onto the n-fold vacuum state or its orthogonal complement, such
that the post-measurement state is either the n-fold vacuum or
has the vacuum removed from the support of the n symbols’ joint
quantum state. The sequential decoder for optical communication
requires the additional ability to perform multimode optical
phase-space displacements—realizable using a beamsplitter and
a laser, while the sequential decoder for quantum reading also
requires the ability to perform phase-shifting (realizable using a
phase plate) and online squeezing (a phase-sensitive ampliﬁer).

g (ηNS ) ≡ (ηNS + 1) log (ηNS + 1) − ηNS log (ηNS ) (1)
bits per channel use, where NS is the mean transmitted photon
number per channel use, and η ∈ (0, 1] is the input-output
power transmissivity. Furthermore, conventional laser-light
(coherent-state) modulation with symbols chosen i.i.d. from an
isotropic Gaussian prior distribution, can achieve this capacity
(i.e., it is not necessary to use exotic non-classical states, such
as squeezed or entangled states). The lossy bosonic channel
√
preserves a coherent state (|α → | ηα ), thus preserving
its purity. The average output state is a zero-mean circularlysymmetric Gaussian mixture of coherent states, which is a
thermal state with mean photon number ηNS , which saturates
the entropy bound g (ηNS ). A converse proof shows that no
other choice of modulation states and/or priors can exceed
this capacity [5]. This result enabled comparing the ultimate
channel capacity with the ideal Shannon limits of the classical
channels induced by the quantum noise-characteristics of
standard optical receivers, such as homodyne, heterodyne and
direct detection receivers [5]. In spite of this accomplishment,
it remains unclear how one could construct an implementation
of the HSW decoding measurement for the bosonic channel
using known optical components.
The theory of HSW also applies in the setting of “quantum
reading” [6], where one can obtain a quantum advantage in
the rate of read out of classical information stored in a digital
memory. Classical bits are encoded into the reﬂectivity and
phase of memory cells. A transmitter irradiates the memory
with light that in turn is modulated by a passive linear
reﬂection from the memory cells (each cell is a single-mode
lossy bosonic channel, but this time information is encoded
in the memory cell’s transmissivity and phase). A monostatic receiver gathers the reﬂected light for measurement and
processing. The above is a bare-bone model for optical disks
such as CDs or DVDs. Pirandola originally considered this
task in the context of quantum channel discrimination and
demonstrated a quantum advantage. He and his collaborators
later considered a coded strategy (in the information-theoretic
sense) [7]. Later work [8], [9] improved upon Ref. [7],
by demonstrating how to achieve the Holevo limit g (NS )
bits/cell, where NS is the mean number of photons available at

One of the ﬁrst accomplishments in quantum information
theory was the upper bound (now known as the Holevo
bound) on how much classical information can be encoded
into a quantum system, such that another party can reliably
recover it using a quantum measurement [1]. Subsequently,
Holevo, Schumacher, and Westmoreland (HSW) proved that
the Holevo bound is also an achievable rate for classical
communication over a quantum channel [2], [3], establishing
a lower bound on a quantum channel’s classical capacity.
These initial results were the impetus for the ﬁeld of quantum
information theory [4], a generalization of Shannon’s classical information theory that takes into account the quantumphysical nature of the carrier of information, channel, and
the receiver measurement. The main accomplishment of HSW
was to provide a mathematical speciﬁcation of a decoding
measurement that a receiver, bound only by the laws of
quantum mechanics, could perform on the output codeword
to recover the classical data transmitted by a sender at any
rate below the Holevo limit. The HSW decoder prescription in
general leads to a collective measurement on the codeword’s
joint quantum state, which may not be doable by detecting
each individual symbol of the codeword separately.
For the single-mode lossy bosonic channel—which can be
used to construct a wide class of practical free-space and ﬁber
optical channels—it was shown that the single-letter Holevo

It turns out however, that the strategy for achieving g (NS )
is different from that of the lossy bosonic channel, and
surprisingly, a coherent-state probe fails to achieve the Holevo
capacity [8], [9]. The classical information is encoded into the
phase of the cells (with each having perfect reﬂectivity). The
symbols of the phase code are chosen i.i.d. and uniformly at
random from the interval [0, 2π). The transmitter shines each
cell with the single-mode quantum superposition state:

that this scheme achieves the Holevo capacity. Section III
provides a summary of the operations needed for sequential
decoding of the lossy bosonic channel. Section IV details an
implementation of a sequential decoder for quantum reading.
We conclude in Section V with a summary and a list of open
questions.
I. D EFINITIONS AND N OTATION
We denote quantum systems as A, B, and C and their
corresponding Hilbert spaces as HA , HB , and HC with
respective dimensions dA , dB , and dC . We denote pure states
A
of the system A with a ket |φ and the corresponding density
A
A
operator as φ = |φ φ| . All kets that are quantum states
have unit norm, and all density operators are positive semideﬁnite with unit trace. We model our lack of access to a
quantum system with the partial trace operation. That is, given
a two-qubit state ρAB shared between Alice and Bob, we
can describe Alice’s state with the reduced density operator:
ρA =TrB ρAB , where TrB denotes a partial trace over Bob’s
system. Let H(A)ρ ≡ −Tr ρA log ρA be the von Neumann
entropy of the state ρA .

and the receiver performs a collective measurement on the
received codeword (|n is a photon number state [10]). The
average state of the received ensemble is a completely dephased version of |φII , yet again, a thermal state with mean
photon number NS , which saturates the entropy bound g (NS ).
Again, the authors of Ref. [8] left open the question of a
structured capacity-achieving receiver measurement.
In this paper, we address the open questions from Refs. [5],
[8], [9], by detailing a structured quantum measurement that
can achieve both of the above Holevo limits (for optical
communication and quantum reading). The measurement is a
sequential decoder, in the sense that it is a sequence of binaryoutcome measurements that ask, “Was the received quantum
state produced from the ﬁrst codeword? the second codeword?
the third?” etc., proceeding until the answer to one of the
questions is “yes.” Our work builds on recent insights of
Giovannetti et al. [11] and Sen [12] in sequential decoding for
quantum channels. Our primary contribution here is to show
how to construct these measurements in an optical setting.
Our sequential decoding scheme for the lossy bosonic
channel requires two capabilities at the receiver. First, the
receiver should be able to apply a “displacement operator,”
which simply requires highly reﬂective beamsplitters and a
strong laser local oscillator [13]. Second, the receiver should
be able to perform a quantum non-demolition measurement
to determine whether an n-mode state is in the vacuum
state or not. That is, the measurement operators are of the
⊗n
⊗n
form {|0 0| , I ⊗n − |0 0| }, where |0 is the vacuum
state and I is the identity operator. After performing such a
measurement on an n-mode state |ψ , the post-measurement
⊗n
⊗n
state should be either |0
or (|ψ − c |0
)/ 1 − |c|2 ,
⊗n
with c = 0| |ψ . The key aspect of this measurement is
that its disturbance to an n-mode state becomes asymptotically
negligible as n becomes large, as long as the number of codewords is no larger than ∼ 2ng(ηNS ) . Our sequential decoding
scheme for quantum reading requires the “vacuum-or-not”
measurement described above, and the ability to perform phase
shifting and online squeezing [10].
We structure this paper as follows. Section I reviews standard deﬁnitions and notation that are helpful for understanding
the rest of the paper. Section II describes how a sequential decoder operates when decoding classical information
transmitted over a pure-state classical-quantum channel, and
for completeness, App. B of Ref. [14] provides a proof

II. S EQUENTIAL D ECODING
In this section, we describe the operation of a sequential
decoder that can reliably recover classical information encoded
into a pure state ensemble. App. B of Ref. [14] contains a
full error analysis, demonstrating that the scheme achieves
capacity.
Suppose that a classical-quantum channel of the form
x → |φx connects a sender Alice to a receiver Bob. For our
purposes here, it does not matter whether the classical input x
is discrete or continuous.
Theorem 1: Let x → |φx be a classical-quantum channel
and let ρ ≡ x pX (x) |φx φx | for some distribution pX (x).
Then the rate H (ρ) bits per channel use is achievable for communication over this channel by having the receiver employ a
sequential decoding strategy.
Proof: We break the proof into several steps.
Codebook Construction. Before communication begins,
Alice and Bob agree upon a codebook. We allow them to
select a codebook randomly according to the distribution
pX (x). So, for every message m ∈ M ≡ 1, . . . , 2nR ,
generate a codeword xn (m) ≡ x1 (m) · · · xn (m) randomly
and independently according to

through n uses of the channel x → |φx leads to the following

by performing the measurement { φxn (1) φxn (1) , I ⊗n −
φxn (1) φxn (1) }. If he receives the outcome “yes,” then
he performs no further measurements and concludes that
Alice transmitted the codeword xn (1). If he receives
the outcome “no,” then he performs the measurement
{ φxn (2) φxn (2) , I ⊗n − φxn (2) φxn (2) } to check if Alice
sent the second codeword. Similarly, he stops if he receives
“yes,” and otherwise, he proceeds along similar lines.
The above concludes the description of the operation of the
sequential decoder. We provide an error analysis demonstrating that this scheme works well in App. B of Ref. [14], i.e., the
word error goes to zero as n → ∞, as long as R < H(ρ). Note
that Sen [12] and Giovannetti et al. [11] already gave a proof
that a sequential decoder works, but our proof in App. B of
Ref. [14] is a bit simpler because it is specialized to the case
of pure-state ensembles (which is sufﬁcient to consider for
our settings of pure-loss optical communication and quantum
reading).

We assume η = 1 above and for the rest of this section without
loss of generality. Thus, the sequential decoder consists of
measurements of the following form for all m ∈ M:
|αn (m) αn (m)| , I ⊗n − |αn (m) αn (m)| .

decoder can implement the measurement in (4) in three steps:
1) Displace the n-mode codeword state by
D (−α1 (m)) ⊗ · · · ⊗ D (−αn (m)) ,
by employing highly asymmetric beam-splitters with a
strong local oscillator [13].
2) Perform a “vacuum-or-not” measurement of the form

If the vacuum outcome occurs, decode as the mth
codeword. Otherwise, proceed.
3) Displace by D (α1 (m)) ⊗ · · · ⊗ D (αn (m)) with the
same method as in Step 1.
The receiver just iterates this strategy for every codeword in
the codebook, and Theorem 1 states this strategy is capacityachieving.
Remark 2: The above strategy is reminiscent of the class of
conditional pulse nulling receivers [15], which are useful in
discriminating M -ary pulse-position-modulation coded states
with |α in the ith slot and vacuum states |0 in the other M −1
slots. In this strategy, the receiver hypothesizes at ﬁrst that
⊗M −1
the transmitted codeword is the ﬁrst codeword |α |0
,
nulls the ﬁrst mode by applying D† (α), and direct-detects the
ﬁrst mode. If the sender in fact transmitted the ﬁrst codeword,
⊗m
then the resulting state is ideally |0
, and direct detection
of the ﬁrst mode should ideally produce no “clicks.” If there
is no click, then the receiver direct detects the other modes to
conﬁrm the original hypothesis. If there are no further clicks,
then the receiver declares that the sender transmitted the ﬁrst
codeword. If there is a further click, then the receiver guesses
the codeword corresponding to the position of the click. If on
the ﬁrst mode there is a click, then the receiver hypothesizes
that the transmitted codeword is the second one and repeats
the above algorithm on the next M − 1 modes.
The difference between the sequential decoding strategy
and conditional pulse nulling is that the codewords are different, and the vacuum-or-not measurement in the sequential
decoding strategy is much more difﬁcult to perform in practice
than direct detection, which annihilates the detected quantum
state. Ideally, the vacuum-or-not should be a non-demolition
⊗n
measurement such that the post-measurement state is |0
⊗n
⊗n
or (|ψ − c |0
)/ 1 − |c|2 , with c = 0| |ψ , if the pre2
measurement state is |ψ , with probabilities p0 = |c| and
p1 = 1 − p0 , respectively, of the two possible outcomes.

We now provide a physical realization of the sequential
decoding strategy in the context of optical communications. In
this setting, we suppose that a lossy bosonic channel, speciﬁed
by the following Heisenberg relations, connects Alice to Bob:
ˆ = √ηˆ + 1 − ηˆ,
b
a
e
(3)
where a, ˆ and e are the respective ﬁeld operators for Alice’s
ˆ b,
ˆ
input mode, Bob’s output mode, and an environmental input
mode (assumed to be in its vacuum state). The transmissivity
η ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of Alice’s input photons that make
it to Bob on average. We assume that Alice is constrained to
using mean photon number NS per channel use.
The strategy for achieving the classical capacity of this
channel is for Alice to induce a classical-quantum channel,
by selecting α ∈ C and preparing a coherent state |α [10] at
the input of the channel in (3). The resulting induced classicalquantum channel to Bob is of the following form:
√
α → | ηα .
By choosing the distribution pX (x) in Theorem 1 to be an
isotropic, complex Gaussian with variance NS :
2

pNS (α) ≡ (1/πNS ) exp − |α| /NS ,
we have that g (ηNS ) is an achievable rate for classical
communication. The quantity g (ηNS ) is the entropy of the
√
average state of the ensemble {pNS (α) , | ηα }:
√
√
d2 α pNS (α) | ηα

which is a thermal state with mean photon number ηNS [10].
Each quantum codeword selected from the ensemble
{pNS (α) , |α } has the following form:
|αn (m) ≡ |α1 (m) ⊗ · · · ⊗ |αn (m) .

Remark 3: The crucial (and most difﬁcult) step in sequential decoding for the lossy bosonic channel is the vacuumor-not measurement. Oi et al. have provided a method for
performing this measurement, by interacting the light ﬁeld
with a three-level atom in a STIRAP process [16]. This
approach would likely be quite lossy in practice, so it would be
ideal to determine an all-optical vacuum-or-not measurement.
Remark 4: If the mean input photon number NS
1, then
one does not require a full Gaussian distributed codebook in
order to achieve capacity. A simpler method, called binary
phase-shift keying, sufﬁces to approach capacity very closely.
In this approach, the ensemble for generating a codebook
randomly is just {1/2, |±α }. This also simpliﬁes the sequential decoder because the only displacements required
for implementation are D (±α). An additional advantage is
that a random linear encoder should achieve the capacity,
by an argument similar to that on pages 3-14 and 3-15 of
Ref. [17]. BPSK polar codes are capacity-achieving for lowphoton number as well [18].
Remark 5: Tan proved a variation of Theorem 1 for the
lossy bosonic channel in her thesis [19], but the analysis
in App. B of Ref. [14] demonstrates that it is actually not
necessary to perform a measurement onto the average typical
subspace. We avoided having to do so by demonstrating that
it is sufﬁcient to code for a typical-projected version of the
channel and applying Sen’s non-commutative union bound
from Ref. [12].
Remark 6: The above sequential decoding approach also
works well in the context of private classical communication
over a lossy bosonic channel [20], [21]. The private classical
capacity of the channel in (3) is g (ηNS ) − g ((1 − η) NS )
(compare to its public classical capacity of g (ηNS )), and
the strategy for encoding is again to choose coherent states
randomly according to an isotropic Gaussian prior. The sequential decoder can just test for all codewords in a codebook
of size 2ng(ηNS ) and recover the transmitted private message
correctly. The privacy in the scheme comes about by choosing 2ng((1−η)NS ) codewords corresponding to each message
and selecting one of these uniformly at random in order to
randomize Eve’s knowledge of the transmitted message [20].

transmitter to the optical memory cells and from the cells back
to the receiver (which is co-located with the transmitter).
The objective is for the transmitter to interrogate each
optical memory cell with some quantum state of light with
mean photon number NS . The receiver then collects all of the
reﬂected light and performs some measurement to recover the
classical information encoded in the memory cells. If we use
a coherent-state transmitter to interrogate each cell, we call
it the Type I setting [8]. If we do not allow the transmitter
to retain any state entangled with the transmitted light, but
allow it to send any quantum state (entangled spatially across
modes or an unentangled non-classical product state), then
this is termed the Type II setting [8]. Finally, if we do allow
for entanglement assistance, in the sense that the transmitter
can prepare two modes in an entangled state for each of the
n memory cells, send one to a memory cell while retaining
the other, then this is termed a Type III setting [8]. In each of
the three settings, the receiver is always allowed to perform
a general (collective) quantum measurement on the reﬂected
n modes (and the retained n modes, in case of Type III). It
is straightforward to prove that g (NS ) is the Holevo (upper)
bound on the capacity of quantum reading in the Type I and
Type II settings, while it is unknown whether g (NS ) could be
exceeded in the Type III setting [8].
Recently, Guha et al. proved that the following strategy
achieves the g (NS ) bound for quantum reading using a Type II
transmitter [8], [9]. The transmitter interrogates each memory
cell with a quantum state of light of the form in (2). It is
straightforward to compute that the mean number of photons
in this state is NS : φII | n |φII = NS , where n = a† a
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ ˆ
is the photon number operator [10]. Each memory cell has
classical information encoded into only the phase variable θi
(with ηi = 1), so that a randomly chosen code in the sense of
Theorem 1 is selected from the following ensemble:

and each θ is selected uniformly at random from the interval
[0, 2π). The average state of this code ensemble is

The sequential decoding strategy also ﬁnds application
in “quantum reading” [6]. In this setting, we suppose that
information is encoded into passive memory cells of an
optically-readable memory, which a transceiver can read out
by irradiating them with laser (or quantum) light and detecting
the reﬂected light. More speciﬁcally, we can model the ith
optical memory cell as a beamsplitter of the following form:

which is a thermal state with mean photon number NS . (The
effect of phase-randomizing the state |φII is simply to dephase it to a thermal state.) Thus, a random code constructed
from the ensemble in (5) along with a sequential decoder
saturates the entropy bound g (NS ) because the average state
is a thermal state.
It is not clear to us at the moment how to implement a sequential decoder for the above Type II strategy.
Though, if we allow for a Type III transmitter, the strategy

where the parameters ηi and θi are the respective reﬂectivity
and phase of the ith cell, and ai , ˆi , and ei are the respective
ˆ b
ˆ
ﬁeld operators for the transmitter’s ith input mode, the ith
reﬂected mode, and an environmental mode (assumed to be
in its vacuum state). We assume perfect channels from the

receiver requires phase shifting and online squeezing.
The most important open problems going forward concern
making the scheme more practical. In this vein, it might
be helpful to realize an all-optical implementation of the
“vacuum-or-not” measurement—which could help both on the
scalability front, and relative ease of implementation as compared to a system that uses atom-light interaction [16]. Also,
the sequential decoding scheme given here is impractical from
a computational perspective because it requires an exponential
number of measurements (there are an exponential number of
codewords). It would be better to have a sequential decoder
that decodes one bit at a time and would thus require only a
linear number of measurements.

where P (θi (m)) = exp{iˆ θi (m)} is a phase shifter, S (r)
n
is a two-mode squeezing operator [10] with the squeezing
⊗2
strength r, s.t. NS = sinh2 r, and |0
is a two-mode
vacuum state. This then leads us to specify the mth step of
the sequential decoder, which proceeds as follows:
1) Apply the operator P † (θi (m)) ⊗ I by phase-shifting
the ﬁrst mode of the ith pair by −θi (m).
2) Apply the unsqueezing operator S † (r). The receiver can
accomplish this with a phase-sensitive ampliﬁer.
3) Perform a “vacuum-or-not” measurement of the same
form as in Step 2 in the previous section. If the vacuum
outcome occurs, decode as the mth codeword. Otherwise, proceed.
4) Apply the squeezing operator S (r).
5) Apply the operator (P (θi (m)) ⊗ I) by phase-shifting
the ﬁrst mode of the ith pair by θi (m).
The receiver again iterates this strategy for all codewords
in the codebook, and Theorem 1 states that this strategy is
Holevo-capacity-achieving, i.e., it achieves g(NS ) bits/cell.
Remark 7: At NS
1, a binary phase-shift keying code
approximately achieves the Holevo limit of g (NS ), i.e.,
CBPSK (NS ) = H2 (1 ± e−2NS )/2 . The code ensemble
for this case is just {(1/2, |φIII ) , (1/2, |φIII,π )}, and the
sequential decoder only needs to have phase shifts of 0 or
π. Interestingly enough, with binary phase modulation, even a
coherent-state (Type I) transmitter can achieve CBPSK (NS ).
V. C ONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that a sequential decoding strategy
achieves the Holevo capacity for optical communication and
quantum reading, by building on information-theoretic works
on sequential decoding in Refs. [11], [12]. Both schemes
employ a “vacuum-or-not” measurement which distinguishes
coherently and in a non-demolition way between the vacuum
or “not vacuum,” so that the disturbance on the encoded state
is asymptotically negligible for long codewords (as long as the
code rate is less than the Holevo limit). For optical communication, the only other operation needed is implementing a
