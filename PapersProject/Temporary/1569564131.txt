Abstract—This paper analyzes the capacity of a three-user
interference channel with a cognitive transmitter which noncausally knows the messages of the other two transmitters.
Especially, We derive the capacity region when all interference
channel gains are strong and show that the capacity is achieved
by superposition coding. From the capacity results for the speciﬁc
channel conditions, we also analyze the capacity region for threeuser Gaussian interference channel with a cognitive transmitter.

Interference management has attracted great attention to
industry and academia due to its crucial inﬂuence on high
spectral efﬁciency. For two-user interference channels, the
capacity was found for the weak and strong interference
regimes in [1] and [2], respectively. [1] showed that sum
capacity is achieved by decoding desired message treating
interference as noise in the weak interference condition. It
was shown in [2] that jointly decoding is optimal in the
strong interference condition. The Han-Kobayashi scheme [3]
which is known as the rate splitting scheme is considered
in the moderate interference regime the best one although
the capacity achieving strategy has not found yet. Recently,
Etkin, Tse and Wang proved that a simple Han-Kobayashi
scheme achieves the capacity within one bit [4] and the
optimal generalized degree of freedom. Compared to a twouser interference channel, interference channels with more
than two users have not been much known yet despite its
importance.
In these days, hierarchical cell architecture becomes popular
due to the requirement of co-existence of heterogeneous networks. In hierarchical cell environments, the characteristics of
interference are quite different from those in conventional cell
environments. According to the topology of the hierarchical
cell structure, each transmitter has a disparity in available
information. The upper layer cells are likely to know the data
to be transmitted from the lower layer cells because data ﬂows
from upper layer cells to lower layer cells through backhaul.
Fig. 1 shows a two-layer cellular architecture where a mother
base station (BS) knows its daughter BSs’ data and operates
as a cognitive transmitter.
If upper layer cells know the data for lower layer cells, the
communications in the layered cell structure are well modeled
by an interference channel with cognitive transmitters. A

Layered cell structure consisting of a mother BS and two daughter

two-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is
called the two-user cognitive interference channel and has been
gradually studied [5]–[8]. The authors of [5] analyzed the
achievable rate when rate splitting [3] and Gel’fand-Pinsker
coding [9] are jointly used. In order to enlarge the rate region,
the authors additionally analyzed the achievable rate when
a cognitive transmitter does not send its own message but
instead transmits the message for the other user. By time
sharing, the rate region was shown to be totally achieved. The
capacity of a two-user interference channel with a cognitive
transmitter was found in the strong interference regime [7] and
the capacity of that channel was found in the weak interference
regime [6]. The authors of [7] showed that superposition
coding with jointly decoding at all receivers is optimal in the
strong interference condition. It is shown in [6] that Gel’fandPinsker coding without rate splitting is capacity achievable
in the weak interference condition. The capacity for other
channel conditions, unfortunately, is not derived yet. In [8],
an efﬁcient strategy was suggested combining rate-splitting
scheme, Gel’fand-Pinsker coding and superposition coding for
general interference conditions.
A three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is not a straightforward extension of a two-user cognitive
interference channel [5]–[8]. A three-user interference channel
has much more possible combinations of channel conditions
compared to a two-user interference channel. The complicated
interactions among the channels make it difﬁcult to ﬁnd
the optimal transmission strategy in a three-user interference

channel. The three-user interference channel with a cognitive
transmitter, nevertheless, has not received much attention
despite its importance and there have been few studies on that
channel. Recently, achievable rate regions were analyzed when
a Gel’fand-Pinsker coding without rate splitting is applied to
the three-user IC with a cognitive transmitter in [10]. This
scheme enlarges the rate region compared to a general threeuser IC by interference cancelation in a cognitive receiver.
However, the capacity of a three-user IC with a cognitive
transmitter in any channel condition has not been known yet.
One thing that is certain is the fact that the proposed scheme
in [10] is not expected to achieve the capacity in a strong
interference channel because it is well known that the message
must be jointly decoded with interference to achieve higher
rate in strong interference channels.
In this paper, we present the capacity region of a threeuser interference channel with a cognitive transmitter. We ﬁrst
classify the channel conditions according to interference channel gains. Then, we identify the optimal strategies and derive
the capacity regions for some channel conditions. Speciﬁcally,
the capacity region when all interference gains are strong is
derived. Based on the capacity results we derived, we study
the capacity region in a Gaussian case.
The rest of this paper is organized as follow. In Section II,
we describe the channel model for a three-user interference
channel with a cognitive transmitter and classify the channel
conditions according to interference gains. The capacity when
all interference gains are strong is analyzed in Section III.
The capacity is also analyzed in Section IV for Gaussian
channels with strong conditions. Finally, we draw conclusions
in Section V.

The capacity region C3−CIC of the three-user interference
channel with a cognitive transmitter is the closure of the set
of all achievable rate triples. Note that if X1 = X1 , X2 = ∅,
and X3 = X2 , C3−CIC (R1 , R2 , R3 ) = C2−CIC (R1 , 0, R2 )
where C2−CIC is the capacity region of the two-user cognitive
interference channel.
For all input distributions pX1 X2 X3 = pX1 pX2 pX3 |X1 X2 ,
a three-user interference channel can be roughly characterized by the three cross-channel conditions – (1) channel
from the cognitive transmitter to the non-cognitive receivers
{S3 → Dk , k ∈ {1, 2}}, (2) channel from the non-cognitive
transmitters to the cognitive receiver {Sk → D3 , k ∈ {1, 2}},
(3) channel from a non-cognitive transmitter to the other noncognitive receiver {Sk → Dl , k, l ∈ {1, 2}, k = l}.
In general, the cross-channel is classiﬁed into three categories, weak, moderate, and strong, so three-user interference
channels can be classiﬁed into 27 (= 33 ) cases. In this paper,
we consider only a case that all cross-channels are strong.

The three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter is given in Fig. 2. S3 and Sk denote cognitive and
non-cognitive senders, respectively, where k ∈ {1, 2}. Receivers are denoted by Dk where k ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Three
independent messages Wk ∈ {1, . . . , 2nRk } for k ∈

Both achievability and converse are proved in the following
subsections, respectively.

This subsection derives an outer bound on the capacity
when both cross-channels from the cognitive transmitter to the
non-cognitive receivers and from the non-cognitive transmitter
to the non-cognitive receiver are strong, i.e., {S3 → Dk :
Strong, k ∈ {1, 2}} and {Sk → Dl : Strong, k, l ∈

A. Achievable Rate Region: An Inner Bound
For the proof of achievability of Theorem 1, this subsection
derives achievable rate region when the encoder 3 adopts
superposition coding and all decoders jointly decode all the
messages from the transmitters. The encoder of a cognitive
n
n
transmitter S3 superimposes W3 on (X1 , X2 ), which are
independently encoded in the encoder 1 and 2. The decoder
Dk , k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, decodes the unique Wk from the received
data by joint decoding.
Theorem 2: If the cognitive transmitter adopts superposition coding and all decoders jointly decode all the messages,
the achievable rate region Rsp is the set of all achievable rate
triples such that
Rsp =

Proof: Fix the distribution p(x1 , x2 , x3 )

The rest of the proof is analysis for error probabilities.
However, we omit it due to space limitations.
If the cross-channel from the non-cognitive transmitter to the
cognitive receiver is strong, i.e., {Sk → D3 : Strong, k ∈
{1, 2}}, the conditions (12), (14), (15) and (16) are satisﬁed
and thus the achievable rate constraints (19), (21) and (24) are
no more needed.

implies the channel gain from transmitter i to receiver j,
and noise variance N0 is equal to 1. For the average power
constraints E[|Xi |2 ] ≤ P where Xi is the signal sent by
transmitter i, the following capacity region for the Gaussian

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied a three-user interference channel
with a cognitive transmitter. For capacity analysis, we ﬁrst
classiﬁed the channel conditions according to the interference
channel gains. Then, we derived the capacity region when all
cross-channels are strong. We derived rate regions achieved
by superposition coding and joint decoding. From these rate
regions and newly derived outer bounds, we concluded that
the capacity region is obtained by superposition coding when
all interference gains are strong. In addition, we derived
the capacity region for Gaussian channels under four simple
channel conditions.

where a2 + b2 ≤ 1 and a, b ∈ R.
Proof: The cognitive transmitter sends the message for
user 1, 2 and 3 with power a2 P , b2 P and (1 − a2 − b2 )P ,
respectively. Thus, the channel conditions and capacity region
in Theorem 4 are obtained from those in Theorem 1. The detail
proof is omitted due to space limitation.
