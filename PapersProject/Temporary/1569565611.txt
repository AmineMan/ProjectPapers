using a more general genie signal, the successive works in
[3], [4], [5] achieved an enhancement of the ETW bound,
which will be called “enhanced ETW outer bound” in this
paper. Since the enhanced ETW bound contains the Kramer
and ETW outer bounds as special cases, the best known outer
bound is given by the enhanced ETW outer bound whose sumrate upper bound was further tightened later by Etkin [6].
In this paper, we turn our attention to a classical approach
for the proof of converse based on auxiliary random variables
in order to achieve a new outer bound on the capacity region
of the two-user Gaussian IC in the weak interference regime.
In particular, we do not construct a genie-aided channel to
outer-bound the capacity region and instead introduce appropriate auxiliary random variables and a conditional version of
the worst additive noise lemma [7]. Thus, we can obtain a
potentially tighter outer bound than those with the aid of a
genie (explicit side information to the receivers). One major
difﬁculty in upper-bounding the differences of conditional
entropies is the fact that the interfering signal terms are
no longer Gaussian distributed but just with average power
constraints. The role of the auxiliary random variables is
to replace arbitrarily distributed interfering signal with i.i.d.
Gaussian random sequences to avoid some difﬁcult terms.
Then, we can apply the conditional worst additive noise lemma
to some differences of conditional entropies to achieve a new
outer bound. Finally, we show by numerical examples that the
new outer bound is tighter than the previously known outer
bounds for certain range of parameters.
Notations: Cov(X) is the variance of X and Cov(X) is the
covariance matrix of X.

Abstract—The best known outer bound on the capacity region
of the two-user Gaussian interference channel is given as the
intersection of regions of genie-aided outer bounds, in which a
genie provides extra side information to the receivers. In this
paper, we present a new outer bound that does not resort to a
genie-aided channel but make use of auxiliary random variables.
In order to obtain such bound, we introduce a conditional version
of the worst additive noise lemma. The new bound is shown to be
tighter than genie-aided bounds for certain range of parameters.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In the past few years, the Gaussian interference channel (IC)
received great attention as a primitive model for a wireless
network with mutually interfering links. While the IC has been
studied over 30 years, the capacity region of the simplest twouser Gaussian IC is not fully characterized yet. We know the
capacity region only in some special cases such as the very
strong and strong interferences.
The capacity region for the more generally encountered
weak interference situation in wireless networks is still an open
problem. Since the works of Kramer [1] and Etkin, Tse, and
Wang [2], however, there has been a signiﬁcant progress to the
characterization of the sum capacity of the two-user Gaussian
IC in the weak interference regime. Following that work, the
sum capacity of the Gaussian IC in the very weak interference
regime was obtained independently and simultaneously by [3],
[4], [5], in which treating interference as noise with Gaussian
inputs was shown to be optimal. The sum-rate upper bounds
(converses) in all these works are based on a genie-aided
channel, in which a genie provides some side information
to either one or both receivers in order to cast the original
interference channel into a mathematically more tractable one.
The characterization of the entire capacity region in the
weak interference regime is less known. In the past decade, one
successful approach was to use a genie-aided channel to obtain
a tight outer bound to the capacity region. Kramer [1] deﬁned
a general genie signal and selected a genie that provides the
exact information of the interference to one of the receivers
such that the resulting genie-aided channel becomes the onesided Gaussian IC, for which an outer bound is known. Etkin
et al. [2] adopted a different genie signal that provides some
noisy observation of the intended signals to the receivers and
derived an outer bound (so-called “ETW outer bound”) tighter
than the Kramer’s one for certain ranges of parameters. By

tighter outer bound on the channel than that in [1]. The authors
designed the genie signal such that

In this section, we provide a new outer bound on the
capacity region of the two-user Gaussian IC. To do so, we
propose a different approach using auxiliary random variables,
without the aid of a genie.

Given the channel inputs X1 and X2 in the previous
section, we introduce auxiliary random variables (U1 , U2 )

provided a meaningful outer bound in [2, Thm. 3] and showed
that a simpliﬁed Han-Kobayashi scheme can achieve a rate
region within one bit to the capacity region of the two-user
Gaussian IC.
Throughout this paper, let Xig ∼ N (0, Pi ) and Yig = Xig +
Zi for all i and the corresponding i.i.d. random sequences are
n

denoted by Xig and Yig , respectively. The known outer bounds
on the capacity region of the IC deﬁned by (1) in the weak
interference regime (i.e., h12 ≤ 1 and h21 ≤ 1) are as follows.
Theorem 1 (ETW bound [2]): The capacity region of a
two-user Gaussian IC in the weak interference regime is
contained in the set of rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) satisfying
R1 ≤ I(X1g ; Y1g |X2g )

where Wi is a zero mean i.i.d. Gaussian random sequence

with variance σWi , independent of (X1 , X2 ) and correlated
to Zi with correlation coefﬁcient ρi , for i = 1, 2. The main

n
to replace the arbitrary random sequence h12 X2 (interference
with an average power constraint) by the Gaussian random
n
n
sequence h12 W1 whose components are i.i.d., and so U2 is.
We provide several lemmas here to make this paper selfcontained, some of which have appeared in different forms.
The following lemma is a generalization of the well-known
result by Thomas [8] that Gaussian distribution maximizes the
conditional distribution for a given covariance constraint.

The inequality (6) may be also viewed as a generalization
of [5, Lem. 1], for which m = 2 and Yin are not arbitrary.
Moreover, our lemma upper-bounds the conditional entropy
of a random sequence with that of a Gaussian random vector,
given the particular covariance constraint that should differ
from [5, Lem. 1] to apply Lemma 1 in our main results.
The following two lemmas are with respect to the worst
additive noise lemma in [7]. The ﬁrst one is a rather straightforward generalization and the second is a conditional version
of the well-known worst additive noise lemma. The latter is
a key inequality in deriving a new outer bound based on
auxiliary random variables in this paper.

Note that the above lemma has a different covariance constraint from [5, Lem. 4] and it is analogous to the conditional
extremal inequality in [10, Thm. 8]. While the conditional
extremal inequality is conditioned on a scalar random variable
U since its proof relies on the classical conditional EPI [9],
our inequality (9) is on a random sequence U n .

therein, our sum-rate upper bound in Theorem 3 is shown
to be tighter in a moderately weak interference regime. For
example, this is the case when 0.42 ≤ h2 < 0.52 for the same
parameters of Fig. 1 in [6], where P = 6. Moreover, such
range of h2 is shown to be gradually widened as P increases.

Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the tightness of the new outer bound
in Section III on the capacity region of the two-user symmetric
Gaussian IC with two channel parameter sets (P = 15, h2 =
0.2) and (P = 10, h2 = 0.3), over the best known genie-aided
outer bound. To compare with the outer bounds that we have
discussed here, we also plot a time division inner bound and a
simpliﬁed case of the HK inner bound that does not consider
time sharing and is limited to only Gaussian distributions for
the private and common messages. Furthermore, compared to
the sum-rate upper bound given in [6] and all other bounds
