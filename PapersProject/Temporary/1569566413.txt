a modulo-additive Gaussian channel,

Abstract—It has long been known that linear codes achieve
the capacity of additive channels over ﬁnite ﬁelds. Much less has
been known about the performance of linear codes over ZM ,
when used for communication over channels that are additive
with respect to this group. Further, linear codes over ZM play
an important role in construction of lattices in Euclidean space.
When a construction-A lattice is used for communication over
an additive white Gaussian noise channel, a modulo-M Z additive
channel with unimodal noise is induced at the receiver. In this
paper it is shown that linear codes over ZM achieve the capacity
of such channels when the cardinality of the alphabet is a power
of a prime.

where by ⊕ we denote addition modulo M , namely, the output
lies in the quotient group R/(M Z), which is identiﬁed with the
interval [0, M ) with addition modulo M . The input is assumed
to belong to an M -PAM constellation, i.e., the input alphabet
is discrete and equally-spaced,
X ∈ {0, 1, . . . , M − 1} .

It is well known that binary linear codes allow to reach
the capacity of binary-input output-symmetric channels. Moreover, the average error probability over an ensemble of random
linear codes tends to 0 as the block length goes to inﬁnity, for
every rate 0 < R < C, where C is the channel’s capacity.
See, e.g., [1]. As an extension to this result, it was shown by
Dobrushin [2] that linear codes over any ﬁnite ﬁeld GF (pm )
achieve the capacity of any symmetric channel with input and
output alphabets X = Y = GF (pm ). More results on the
performance of algebraic codes were derived by Ahlswede
and Gemma [3], [4].
In recent works, Como and Fagnani [5], [6] studied the
capacity of Abelian group codes over symmetric channels. In
their work they obtained an expression for the capacity of such
codes, which involves some optimization problem, and derived
an explicit expression for the capacity in the case where the
group is ZM , M being a power of a prime. As a special
case, they showed that the ensemble of linear codes over ZM ,
M being a power of a prime, achieves the capacity of any
additive isotropic decreasing noise (AIDN) channel (see [5],
[6] for details), where the input symbols are restricted to a PSK
constellation, i.e., the M input symbols are equally-spaced
along a circle around the origin. As an important example, they
show that the family of AIDN channels includes the (complex)
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.
In this work, we consider linear codes over ZM , used over

.

This reﬂects the fact that the input to the physical channel
should be centered around the origin. The signal-to-noise ratio
P
(SNR) is deﬁned as SNR σ2 .
It is well known that in the high SNR regime, the effect
of the modulo operation becomes negligible, and the modM AWGN channel has approximately the same mutual information as the uniform-input AWGN channel (without the
modulo). For large enough alphabet size, the gap between this
mutual information and the capacity of the AWGN is upper1
bounded by 2 log 2πe . Thus, a uniform distribution over a
12
PAM constellation achieves, for a large enough alphabet size
M , the full degrees of freedom of the channel, i.e.,

is the capacity of the AWGN channel with only a power constraint imposed on the input (i.e., the input is not constrained
to belong to any constellation, but only its power is limited),
and CPAM (SNR) is the capacity of a dense PAM constellation,
namely,

The PSK constellation on the other hand, while achieving
rates close to capacity for low SNR, is essentially a onedimensional constellation embedded in two-dimensional signal
space, and therefore it can only achieve half of the degrees of
freedom of the channel,

likelihood decoding can be performed in two steps: ﬁrst,
decoding the codeword c ∈ C obtained by reducing the
output modulo M Zn , and then applying a symbol-by-symbol
slicer of step size M . Thus, the performance of the resulting
communication scheme will depend on the performance of
the linear code C over an effective modulo-additive noise
channel, as given in (1). Furthermore, if a low error ﬂoor
(due to the uncoded slicer operation) is desired, the cardinality
of the linear code M must be increased. However, unless
M is a prime, it has not been known whether capacity can
be achieved using linear codes over ZM for modulo-additive
noise channels.
In the present work, we derive an explicit upper bound on
the error probability of linear codes over ZM for moduloadditive noise channels,

where, CPSK (SNR) is the capacity of a dense PSK constellation, i.e., the input signal is restricted to lie on a circle around
the origin. For details see, e.g., [7], [8].
The above observations are demonstrated in Figure 1, which
depicts the capacities of QAM and modulo-additive QAM
versus PSK constellations as a function of the SNR. It can be
seen that PSK is nearly optimal at low rates (which correspond
to low SNR), but as the SNR grows it becomes inferior to
QAM and to modulo-additive QAM.1

Y =X ⊕Z.
The channel input X is taken from an M -PAM constellation
(2), and Z is some random variable with probability density
function fZ , statistically independent of X.
It is important to note that even for such channels, whose
capacity is achieved by a uniform input distribution, it is
not guaranteed that the capacity can be achieved using linear
codes over ZM . As an example, consider the following noise
distribution with M = 4,

In this paper we show that if M is a power or prime, then
there exist linear codes over ZM that achieve the capacity
of any unimodal modulo-additive channel, where Z is either
discrete or continuous.
Deﬁnition 1: A continuous probability density function
fZ (z), 0 ≤ z < M , is said to be unimodal if there exists
0 ≤ m < M such that fZ (z) is non-decreasing between 0
and m, and non-increasing between m and M .

Gaussian noise channel, as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. The marked
lines represent dense constellations, whereas the unmarked lines represent
constellations which contain a ﬁnite number of points. QAM∗ represents the
modulo-additive AWGN channel.

Further motivation to study the channel (1) is its connection
to lattice codes. Recently there has been a growing interest
in the use of lattices for various multi-user Gaussian network
communication problems. See, e.g., [9] and references therein.
Various methods have been proposed for constructing lattices
suitable for such applications. Since much is known about
linear codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds, work has been done in order to
leverage such codes for building lattices; see, e.g., [10].
A practical and simple method to obtain lattices for communication is via Construction A. In this method, an ndimensional lattice is deﬁned by Λ = C + M Zn , where C
is a linear code over ZM .
When an (unrestricted) lattice obtained by Construction A is
used for communication over an AWGN channel, maximum-

pZ (z),

z = 0, 1, . . . , M − 1

is deﬁned in an analogous manner.
It is readily veriﬁed that the family of unimodal moduloadditive channels includes the mod-M AWGN channel for
any noise variance (1) (i.e., that the folding of the Gaussian
distribution does not violate unimodality).
II. M AIN R ESULT
Consider a modulo-additive and memoryless channel:

1 Note

that modulo-additive M -PSK is equivalent to modulo-additive
M 2 -QAM, due to the component-wise modulo operation.

Y =X ⊕Z,

2

where the input alphabet is X ∈ {0, 1, . . . , M − 1}, and Z
is some random variable independent of X. It is well known
that the capacity of this channel is achieved by a uniform input
distribution. Therefore, the channel’s capacity is given by:
C = H(X ⊕ Z) − H(Z) ,

Corollary 1: For every ǫ > 0 there exists a linear code (4),
such that using this code over the modulo-additive AWGN
channel:
Y =X ⊕Z

(3)

(M being a power of a prime) with Z ∼ N(0, σ 2 ) achieves
Pe < ǫ, provided that the code rate R is lower than the
capacity of the channel.

where X is a random variable distributed uniformly on
{0, 1, . . . , M − 1}, independent of Z, and H denotes either
entropy (in the discrete case) or differential entropy (in the
continuous case).
The standard ensemble of (N, K) linear codes, N, K ∈ N,
is deﬁned as follows,
x(u) = Gu ⊕ v0

T HEOREM 1

Throughout the proof, we assume that Z is a continuous
random variable, having a unimodal probability density function fZ (z) , 0 ≤ z < M (see Deﬁnition 1). The proof
for the discrete case is analogous, replacing the probability
density function fZ (z) with a discrete probability function
pZ (z) , z = 0, 1, . . . , M − 1.
Without loss of generality, all the logarithms in this section
are taken to base p.
In the case M = pr , taking g = pr−q , (5) is equivalent to

Standard bounding techniques (cf., e.g., [1]) yield the
following lemma, which gives a sufﬁcient condition for the
existence of capacity-achieving linear codes over ZM .

there exist N ∈ N and a linear code (4) over ZM , with

K = log(M) , that achieves a probability error lower than ǫ.

(q + 1)H(Z | Z mod pr−q )
≤ qH(Z | Z mod pr−q−1 )

Proof: See Appendix A.

∀q = 1, 2, . . . , r − 1 .

(6)

Using the chain rule, we have
Remark 1: For an alphabet size that is a power of a prime
M = pr , Lemma 1 coincides with [6, Example 9].
Our main result states that (5) holds for any unimodal
modulo-additive channel, given that the alphabet size is a
power of a prime, M = pr . Namely, for every 1 < g < M
such that M is divisible by g, the condition (5) is satisﬁed.
We thus have the following theorem.
Theorem 1: Let M > 1 be a power of a prime, and let Z be
any unimodal (either discrete or continuous) random variable,
taking values in [0, M ). Let C be the capacity of the channel

H(Z | Z mod pm−q )

= H(Z | Z mod pm−q , Z mod pm−q−1 )

= H(Z | Z mod pm−q−1 )

− H(Z mod pm−q | Z mod pm−q−1 ) ,

so that (6) can be rewritten as
H(Z | Z mod pm−q−1 )

≤ (q + 1)H(Z mod pm−q | Z mod pm−q−1 ) .

We prove a stronger result: for every y we show that

Y =X ⊕Z,

H(Z | Z = y mod pm−q−1 )

where the input alphabet is X ∈ {0, 1, . . . , M − 1}, and let
R < C. Then for every ǫ > 0 there exist N ∈ N and a linear
NR
code (4) over Zm , with K = log(M) , such that Pe < ǫ, where
Pe is the error probability obtained by using the code over the
channel combined with maximum-likelihood decoding.

≤ (q + 1)H(Z mod pm−q | Z = y mod pm−q−1 ) .

(7)

Before we prove (7), we need to introduce some notations.
Let q and let y ∈ [0, M ). Deﬁne a normalized probability
vector W = (W (0), . . . , W (pq+1 − 1)), where

The proof, which is presented in the next section, is based on
the proof of [6, Theorem 25], with some modiﬁcations needed
to replace the PSK constellation with PAM, and replacing the
AIDN condition with a unimodality condition.
Since the modulo-additive Gaussian channel is unimodal,
we have the following corollary,

in [6, Lemma 21], we have q

(5) holds for any unimodal noise distribution. However, this
has not yet been proved, except of some special cases that
we present in the following two examples. An example of the
numerical evidence is given in [11].

We now derive the sufﬁcient condition (5) for achieving the
channel’s capacity. We start with the following simple lemma:
Lemma 3: The capacity (3) can be written as

Note that this reordering affects neither the left nor the right
hand side of (10). Therefore, from now on we assume without
loss of generality that (11) holds.
We proceed as in [6]: Let Z(j) be a random variable
on {0, . . . , pq − 1} with distribution µj , and let the p-adic
expansion of Z(j) be denoted by

C = log(M ) − H (Z | Z mod 1) .

(14)

Proof: For the case of discrete noise, Z = Z mod 1, and
(14) is reduced to the well-known C = log(M ) − H(Z) . If Z
is continuous, the proof follows by straightforward calculation,
