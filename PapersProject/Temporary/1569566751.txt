A Game Theoretic Model for the Gaussian
Broadcast Channel

ple access channel (MAC), the Gaussian interference channel
etc have been extensively studied under this framework (see
[1]–[6] and the references therein for a detailed survey). However, in scenarios such as the GBC, the choice of actions of one
player may restrict the set of feasible choices for every other
player [7], [8] (see [9] for a discussion on parallel Gaussian
interference channels for an example scenario). Interaction of
players at the level of feasible sets makes the problem much
harder than standard non-cooperative games. The problem of
determining the equilibrium points of games with coupled
constraints is called the generalized Nash equilibrium problem
(GNEP) [2], [7], [9] and the points themselves are called
generalized Nash equilibria (GNE). From a game theoretic
perspective, the broadcast channel has received very little
attention as compared to other channels such as the MAC.
A discrete memoryless broadcast channel with two users
and a resource manager was considered and impact of the
information available to the resource manager in modifying
utility of each user was studied in [10].
The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We
model the interaction between receivers getting data over a
GBC, with the transmitter employing dirty paper coding or
linear precoding, as a GNEP. The transmitter computes the
precoding matrix for the message intended for each receiver
and the precoding matrices are coupled by a common joint
constraint. (2) We ﬁrst show that there exists at least one GNE
for the broadcast channel. In fact, it is well know that under
mild conditions there may exist inﬁnitely many GNEs for a
given GNEP [7], [8]. Games in which each player has the same
coupled constraints, such as in the broadcast channel game,
belong to a special class whose GNEs can be characterized
with weight vectors. The GNEs of this special class, ﬁrst
deﬁned by Rosen [7], are called normalized equilibrium (NoE)
points. (3) Using Rosen’s methodology, we show that for
every feasible weight vector there exists at least one NoE.
We ﬁrst derive a sufﬁcient condition for the uniqueness of
the NoE [6], [7] and for the special case of the aligned
and degraded broadcast channel determine the set of weight
vectors for which the NoE is unique. The uniqueness of the
weight vector enables the implementation of equilibria using
distributed mechanisms [11].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
brieﬂy introduces the model for the broadcast channel and
presents several game theoretic deﬁnitions and preliminaries
useful for the rest of the paper. Section III discuss the existence
and uniqueness of NoEs and Section IV concludes this paper.

Abstract—The strategic behavior of receivers (players) in a
multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian broadcast channel is
investigated using the framework of non-cooperative game theory.
In contrast to the non-cooperative Gaussian multiple access
channel game in which each player’s feasible set of actions is
independent of the actions of other players, the action space of
receivers in the Gaussian broadcast channel is mutually coupled,
usually by a sum power or joint covariance constraint, and hence
cannot be treated using traditional Nash equilibrium solution
concepts. To characterize the strategic behavior of receivers in a
broadcast channel game, this paper treats the broadcast channel
power allocation (or covariance matrix selection) as a generalized
Nash equilibrium problem with common constraints. The concept
of normalized equilibrium (NoE) is used to characterize the
equilibria and the existence and uniqueness of NoEs are proven
for key scenarios.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cooperation between wireless nodes has emerged as a key
paradigm that can yield tremendous performance gains in a
wireless network. Most networks are based on the assumption
that nodes voluntarily cooperate with each other. The emergence of heterogenous networks in which nodes are controlled
by different entities violates this assumption of voluntary
cooperation. The goal of our work is to develop game theoretic
models for a large wireless network to understand how nodes
interact and cooperate and how the beneﬁts of cooperation can
be shared between various nodes. To achieve this goal, we
would ﬁrst like to understand how several nodes in interact
in elementary networks such as multiple access channels,
broadcast channels etc, which form the building blocks of
larger networks.
To this end, we ﬁrst studied the problem of transmitter
cooperation and utility sharing in a Gaussian multiple access
channel in [1]. In this paper, we introduce a game-theoretic
model for the Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) to model
strategic non-cooperative behavior among receivers using the
concept of normalized equilibria. Such a model allows us
to determine whether points on the Pareto boundary are
equilibria, mechanism to enforce such equilibria in a scenario
with coupled constraints across players and pave the way to
study receiver cooperation in a broadcast setting.
In a typical game, the actions of each player are independent
of other players. Several scenarios such as the Gaussian multiThis research has been funded in part by the following grants and organizations: NSF CCF-0917343, NSF IIS 0917410, CAREER CNS-0954116,

function of the kth player for the rest of this paper. Given the
actions Q−k picked by all other players, the set of feasible
actions available to the kth player are determined by the joint
constraints of the problem and are denoted by Ak (Q−k ), the
feasible set or action space of the kth player. We emphasize
that the set Ak (Q−k ) is a function of the actions of the other
players. Each player, given the strategies of all other players,
picks a strategy that solves the maximization problem

In this section, we describe the signal model and state
several game theoretic concepts used throughout this paper.
A. Signal Model
Consider a general multiuser multi-input multi-output
(MIMO) broadcast channel with one transmitter and K receivers. Let us denote the transmitted signal by x, a vector of
length t, where is the number of transmit (TX) antennas. The
TX signal is the sum of independent signals xk , each drawn
from a Gaussian codebook and intended for the kth receiver
(RX).

max vk (Qk , Q−k ) subject to Qk ∈ Ak (Q−k ).

Let Bk (Q−k ) denote the set of all the solutions for this
maximization problem. The GNEP is the problem of ﬁnding
Q∗ such that

Q∗ ∈ Bk (Q∗ ) for all k = 1, 2, ..., K.

where Hk is the rk × t channel gain matrix from the TX to
the kth RX and ri is the number of antennas at the ith RX.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the TX signaling
is constrained by a covariance matrix S ≽ 0 [12].

Deﬁne B(Q) = ×K Bk (Q−k ). In other words, the GNEP is
k=1
to ﬁnd a ﬁxed point Q∗ such that Q∗ ∈ B(Q∗ ) and Q∗ solves
the maximization in (5) for the players. Such a point is called
a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) or a solution to the
GNEP. A point Q∗ = (Q∗ , ..., Q∗ ) is therefore an equilibrium
1
K
if no player can increase his objective function by unilaterally
changing Qk to any other feasible point.
2) Normalized Equilubrium: A GNEP usually has multiple
or even inﬁnitely many solutions [7]. A special class of
GNEPs, called GNEP with shared common constraints was
considered in Rosen [7]. This class is characterized by the fact
that the constraints involving multiple players are common to
all the players. Rosen proposed a solution concept called the
normalized equilibrium (NoE) to characterize such GNEPs. In
these games, the regulator (the TX here) seeks a solution that
can be adopted by competitive players (here RXs) such that
the common constraints, which are dependent on the control
variables of each player, are fulﬁlled (see [11] for a detailed
discussion). An NoE is deﬁned in terms of a speciﬁc constant
rk , which determines the dual variables for the kth player. The
NoE is a GNE for which the Lagrange multipliers (shadow
prices) associated with the shared constraints are equal among
all players up to constant factors, and its uniqueness is
guaranteed under appropriate conditions [7].
GNEs are not directly self-enforceable like a Nash equilibrium as it is not feasible to assume that each player picks
his strategy independently and the selected strategies satisfy
the coupled constraints. However, NoEs of a GNEP have
signiﬁcant explanatory power. For example, we would like to
know which points on the Pareto boundary are also NoEs and
what values of ri (weights for each player [7], [11]) must
be adopted to implement a particular equilibrium. Analysis of
NoEs can help the regulator (TX here) in implementing the
equilibrium solution in a distributed fashion [11].

The covariance matrix Qk ≽ 0 captures the signaling direction
for the kth user. The signal x is transmitted over a GBC and
the signal at the kth receiver can be expressed as
y k = Hk x + nk , nk ∼ N (0, Nk ),

(5)

(3)

i=1

The scenario with a sum power constraint, i.e., can be similarly
modeled as
(
)
Tr E[xxT ] ≤ Ptot ,
(4)
where Ptot is the maximum transmit sum power for all the
antennas. For simplicity of illustration, we only consider the
covariance matrix constraint in this paper; all the results
derived are also valid for sum power constraint as well. We
now deﬁne a class of broadcast channels which are simpliﬁed
versions of the general GBC [12].
1) AMBC: A MIMO BC is called aligned if the number of
transmit antennas is equal to the number of antennas at each
of the receivers (t = r1 = r2 = . . . = rK ) and the channel
gain matrices are all identity matrices (Hi = It×t ).
2) ADBC: A MIMO BC is called aligned and degraded if
the BC is aligned and the covariances of the Gaussian noise at
the receiver are ordered such that 0 ≺ N1 ≼ N2 ≼ ... ≼ NK ,
where A ≼ B implies that B − A is a positive semi-deﬁnite
matrix.
B. Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems
1) Deﬁnition: Formally, a GNEP consists of K players
with each player controlling the variables Qk (Qk are positive
semi-deﬁnite covariance matrices in our problem). Each player
has an objective function, vk , which depends on Qk as well
as the controlling variables of all other players denoted by
Q−k . We denote the utility function by vk (Qk , Q−k ) or
vk (Q), Q = (Q1 , Q2 , ..., QK ) to emphasize the dependence
on the controlling variables and will be called the utility

C. Concave games, existence and uniqueness of NoEs
Deﬁnition 1. A game is said to be concave if the set of allowed
strategies of all the players is a convex set, the utility functions
are concave in each players control variables and continuous
in the control variables of all other players.
Let us denote by F the set of jointly feasible strategies of
the players, and by Fk the projection of F on the space from

2

which the control variables for the kth player come from. Then
F ⊆ F1 ×F2 ...×FK , with equality satisﬁed when the control
variables do not have any joint constraints. Let us deﬁne the
function
f (P, Q, r) =

K
∑

which are players in the game. We assume Gaussian codebooks are used for communication and each RX’s control variable is the covariance matrix Qi ≽ 0 of the signal xi intended
for that receiver RX i . All these players are constrained by
∑K
a joint covariance constraint given by i=1 Qi ≼ S. Thus,
it is clear that the dependent constraints are common to each
player and hence this game belongs to the class of GNEPs
which can be characterized by NoEs.
We consider both linear precoding [13] and dirty paper
coding (DPC) [12] based encoding schemes at the TX. For the
DPC, we also assume a ﬁxed encoding order at the TX without
time-sharing between orders. Each player obtains a rate (the
game utility) based on the choice of actions of all other players
and the TX. For a general GBC, if the data streams are linearly
precoded at the TX with covariance matrices Qi , the utility
function (rate achievable) of the k th player can be written as
[13]:

ﬁxed point condition
Q∗ = arg max f (P, Q∗ , r),

where the maximization is carried out over the convex set F.
For concave games, the existence of NoEs is guaranteed by
Theorem 3 in [7] for all vectors r in the positive orthant. Note
that for any given value of r, there could be multiple NoEs. We
now state a sufﬁcient condition for the uniqueness of NoEs.
∑K
Let σ(Q, r) = i=1 ri vi (Qi , Q−i ), ri > 0 be a weighted
sum of the utilities of each player, where Q are the control
variables for all the players and r a vector containing a set of
weights.

Similarly, if the data streams are coded using DPC with
encoding order (K, K − 1, ..., 1), then the utility function of
the kth player can be written as [12]:
(
)
∑k
H
|Ni + Hi ( i=1 Qi )Hi |
vk (Qk , Q−k ) = log
. (13)
∑k−1
H
|Ni + Hi ( i=1 Qi )Hi |

(9)

It is easy to see that the utilities of the kth player, vk (Qk , Q−k )
in (12) and (13), are concave in Qk and continuous in the
control variables of all the other players.

where ∇i is the derivative w.r.t the ith players’control variables is called the pseudo-gradient of σ(Q, r).

B. Existence of NoEs

Deﬁnition 3. Vector valued strategies [7]: The function
σ(x, r) is called diagonally strictly concave (DSC) in vector
valued strategies for x ∈ F and a ﬁxed r ∈ RK if for every
x0 , x1 ∈ F, we have
(x1 − x0 )T g(x0 , r) + (x0 − x1 )T g(x1 , r) > 0.

Proposition 1. The broadcast channel game with linear precoding or DPC is a concave game and hence for each weight
vector in the positive orthant, r = (r1 , r2 , ..., rK ), rk > 0,
there exists at least one NoE.

(10)

Proof: Each player’s control variable in the broadcast
channel game is the signaling covariance matrix Qi . By
deﬁnition Qi ≽ 0. In addition, the sum power constraint or
the joint covariance constraint ensure that the set of jointly
feasible strategies is compact and convex. The kth player’s
utility is concave in Qk and is continuous in Q−k and hence
the broadcast channel game is a concave game. From Theorem
3 of [7], we know that a concave game has at least one NoE
for every positive weight vector r.

The DSC condition represents the fact that the utility
function a user is more sensitive to his control variable than
the control variables of all other players. From Theorem 4 in
[7], we know that for vector valued strategies, if σ(x, r) is
DSC for every r ∈ R, where R is a convex subset of the
positive orthant, then for each r ∈ R the NoE is unique.
Deﬁnition 4. Matrix valued strategies [6]: The function
σ(Q, r) is called DSC in matrix valued strategies for Q ∈ F
and a ﬁxed r ∈ RK if for every Q0 , Q1 ∈ F, we have
[
]
Tr (Q1 − Q0 )T g(Q0 , r) + (Q0 − Q1 )T g(Q1 , r) > 0. (11)

C. Uniqueness of NoEs

We show that if for matrix valued strategies, the DSC
condition is satisﬁed for every r ∈ R, then the NoE is unique
for that r ∈ R.

We now derive the condition for the uniqueness of the
equilibrium points. We start by assuming that for a given r
there exist multiple equilibrium points and then arrive at a
contradiction which proves the uniqueness.

II. If for the broadcast channel game, we have that α > 0 for
some r then we have arrived at a contradiction and hence there
cannot exist multiple NoE for that r. For all such r, α > 0 is
a sufﬁcient condition for the uniqueness of the NoE.
Note that we have derived the sufﬁcient condition for
uniqueness of the NoE for the broadcast channel game with
joint covariance constraints. We state without proof that the
DSC condition with matrix valued strategies holds for a more
general scenarios (for example, sum power or per-antenna
power constraint or other common constraints) and is not
restricted to the broadcast channel problem (see [7] for a
discussion on how the DSC condition with vector valued
strategies holds for concave games in general).
We now consider special cases for the broadcast channel
and determine which values of r result in unique NoEs. We
ﬁrst state two trace inequalities that will be used to derive the
uniqueness results.

problems with common dependent constraints. We showed the
existence of the normalized equilibrium points, the solutions of
the GNEP with coupled constraints, for the Gaussian broadcast
channel with dirty paper coding and linear precoding strategies. In general, there exist multiple equilibrium points for a
GNEP. We then derived a sufﬁcient condition to determine

the uniqueness of equilibria for the aligned and degraded

the values of Ai and Bi in Eq. 18, it is straight forward to see
that Tn ≥ 0. For an ADBC channel having identity channel

Tn > 0 and hence the normalized equilibrium points of the

It is clear that the region of weight vectors r for which
uniqueness can be shown is dependent on the tightness of the
matrix trace inequalities. For K = 2, the inequality in (18) has
been improved to the inequality in (19). Thus for the 2-user
ADBC, the uniqueness can be derived for a more general set
of weight vectors.

Theorem 3. For a 2-user ADBC with dirty paper coding at
the transmitter and interference canceling receivers, a unique
normalized equilibrium point exists for r1 ≥ r2 /4 > 0.
Proof: The proof follows exactly on the lines of Theorem
2 with the DSC condition decomposing into two terms given

by (r1 − r4 )T1 and r4 T2 . Now using the inequality in (19) with
w = 1, it is easy to show that there exists a unique normalized
equilibrium point for each point in the region r1 ≥ r2 /4 > 0.
E. Discussion
We have characterized the unique NoEs of the ADBC
above. As the proof of uniqueness makes explicit use of the
degradedness of the broadcast channel, it cannot be directly
extended to the AMBC and the general GBC. Characterizing
the uniqueness of the NoEs for the AMBC and the GBC
and computation of these equilibria [9] is currently being
investigated. In addition, we note that the uniqueness results
for the linear precoding scenario are not straight forward from
the DSC condition in Theorem 1.
IV. C ONCLUSIONS
Strategic behavior among rational non-cooperative receivers
in a Gaussian broadcast channel has not been studied so far in
