(a term ﬁrst coined in [5]) being sufﬁcient for DMToptimality. It was later shown in [6] that the DMT-optimal
STBC-schemes constructed in [4] are also approximately
universal for arbitrary number of receive antennas. Several
other STBC-schemes with NVD have been proposed - for
example, see [7], [8], [9] and references therein.

Abstract—For an nt transmit, nr receive antenna (nt × nr )
MIMO system with quasi-static Rayleigh fading, it was shown
by Elia et al. that space-time block code-schemes (STBCschemes) which have the non-vanishing determinant (NVD)
property and are based on minimal-delay STBCs (STBC block
length equals nt ) with a symbol rate of nt complex symbols
per channel use (rate-nt STBC) are diversity-multiplexing gain
tradeoff (DMT)-optimal for arbitrary values of nr . Further,
explicit linear STBC-schemes (LSTBC-schemes) with the NVD
property were also constructed. However, for asymmetric
MIMO systems (where nr < nt ), with the exception of the
Alamouti code-scheme for the 2×1 system and rate-1, diagonal
STBC-schemes with NVD for an nt × 1 system, no known
minimal-delay, rate-nr LSTBC-scheme has been shown to
be DMT-optimal. In this paper, we ﬁrst obtain an enhanced
sufﬁcient criterion for an STBC-scheme to be DMT optimal
and using this result, we show that for certain asymmetric
MIMO systems, many well-known LSTBC-schemes which
have low ML-decoding complexity are DMT-optimal, a fact
that was unknown hitherto.

I. I NTRODUCTION

A. Motivation for our results
There exist several LSTBCs which transmit less than
nt independent complex symbols per channel use, and
STBC-schemes consisting of these LSTBCs have neither
been reported to have the NVD property (although they
do have the NVD property which is shown in this paper),
nor have been claimed to be DMT-optimal in literature.
Examples of such LSTBCs are the full-diversity Quasiorthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) [10], STBCs from co-ordinate
interleaved orthogonal designs [11], four-group decodable
STBCs [12], [13], which are all rate-1 STBCs1 and are
characterized by low ML-decoding complexity. For these
LSTBC-schemes, the sufﬁcient criterion provided in [4] for
DMT-optimality, which requires that LSTBCs transmit nt
independent complex symbols per channel use irrespective
of the number of receive antennas, is not applicable. Hence,
there is a clear need for obtaining a new DMT-criterion that
can take into account LSTBC-schemes with NVD that are
based on rate-p LSTBCs, p < nt .
Further, for asymmetric MIMO systems (nr < nt ), the
standard sphere decoder [14] cannot be used in entirety
to decode rate-nt LSTBCs. It has been shown analytically in [15] that the ﬁxed complexity sphere decoder
[16], although provides quasi maximum-likelihood (ML)
performance, helps achieve the same diversity order of MLdecoding with a worst case complexity of the order of
√
M K , where M is the number of possibilities for each
symbol and K is the dimension of the search, while an
exhaustive ML-search would incur a complexity of the
order of M K . In the same paper, it has also been shown
that the gap between quasi ML-performance and the actual
ML-performance approaches zero at high signal-to-noise
ratio, independent of the constellation employed. Both the
ﬁxed complexity sphere decoder and the standard sphere
decoder can be used to decode at most rate-nmin LSTBCs

BACKGROUND

Space-time coding (STC) [1] for multiple-input, multipleoutput (MIMO) antenna systems has extensively been studied as a tool to exploit the diversity provided by the MIMO
fading channel while achieving reliable data transmission at
high bit rates. In particular, when the delay requirement of
the system is less than the coherence time of the channel,
Zheng and Tse showed in their seminal paper [2] that for the
Rayleigh fading channel with STC, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between the diversity gain and the multiplexing
gain, referred to as the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff
(DMT). The optimal DMT was also characterized with the
assumption that the block length of the space-time block
codes (STBC) of the scheme is at least nt + nr − 1, where
nt and nr are the number of transmit and receive antennas,
respectively. The ﬁrst explicit DMT-optimal STBC-scheme
was presented in [3] for 2 transmit antennas and arbitrary
number of receive antennas and subsequently, in another
landmark paper [4], explicit DMT-optimal STBC-schemes
consisting of both square (minimal-delay) and rectangular
STBCs from cyclic division algebras were presented for
arbitrary values of nt and nr . In the same paper, for general
STBC-schemes, a sufﬁcient criterion for achieving DMToptimality was given which, for a class of STBC-schemes
based on linear STBCs (LSTBCs) employing QAM and
transmitting nt complex information symbols per channel
use, translates to the non-vanishing determinant property

1 Throughout this paper, a rate-p LSTBC means an LSTBC that transmits
p independent complex symbols per channel use.

(nmin = min(nt , nr )). This motivates one to investigate the
DMT-optimality of rate-nmin LSTBC-schemes (see Deﬁnition 4). In literature, only certain rate-nr LSTBC-schemes
have been known to be DMT-optimal for asymmetric MIMO
systems - the Alamouti code-scheme [17] for the 2 × 1
system [2], rate-1, diagonal LSTBC-schemes with NVD for
any nt × 1 system [6], and rate-nr , rectangular LSTBCschemes for nr = 2 and nr = nt − 1 [18].

variance. The average signal-to-noise ratio at each receive
antenna is denoted by SN R.
Deﬁnition 1: (Space-time block code) A space-time
block code (STBC) of block-length T for an nt transmit
antenna MIMO system is a ﬁnite set of complex matrices
belonging to Cnt ×T .
Deﬁnition 2: (STBC-scheme) An STBC-scheme X is deﬁned as a family of STBCs indexed by SN R, each STBC
of block length T , so that X = {X (SN R)}, where the
STBC X (SN R)
{Xi (SN R), i = 1, · · · , |X (SN R)|}
corresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio of SN R at each
receive antenna.
So, at a signal-to-noise ratio of SN R, the codeword
matrices of X (SN R) are transmitted over the channel.
Assuming that all the codeword matrices of X (SN R) are
equally likely to be transmitted, we have

B. Contributions and paper organization
The contributions of this paper are the following.
1) We present an enhanced criterion for DMT-optimality
of general STBC-schemes. This criterion enables us to
encompass all rate-nmin LSTBC-schemes with NVD,
which was not possible using the criterion in [4].
2) In the context of LSTBCs, we show that STBCschemes based on rate-nr LSTBCs whose real symbols take values from PAM constellations are DMToptimal (for nr < nt ) if they have the NVD property.
3) Finally, we show that some well known low
ML-decoding complexity STBC-schemes are DMToptimal for certain asymmetric MIMO systems (see
Table I).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II deals with the system model and relevant deﬁnitions,
Section III presents the main result of the paper - an
enhanced sufﬁcient criterion for DMT-optimality of general
STBC-schemes, and also presents a new criterion for DMToptimality of LSTBC-schemes. A discussion on the DMToptimality of several low ML-decoding complexity LSTBCschemes is presented in Section IV.
Due to space constraints, the proofs of several claims and
other illustrative examples are provided in [20].
Notations: Throughout the paper, bold, uppercase letters
are used to denote matrices. For a complex matrix X, the
Hermitian, the determinant and the Frobenius norm of X are
denoted by XH , det(X) and X , respectively. The set of
all real numbers, complex numbers and integers are denoted
by R, C and Z, respectively. The real and the imaginary
parts of a complex number x are denoted by xI and xQ ,
respectively, and |S| denotes the cardinality of the set S.

Deﬁnition 3: (Optimal DMT curve) [2] The optimal
diversity-multiplexing gain curve d∗ (r) that is achievable
with any STBC-scheme for an nt × nr MIMO system is
a piecewise-linear function connecting the points (k, d(k)),
k = 0, 1, · · · , nmin , where d(k) = (nt − k)(nr − k).
Theorem 3 of [4], which provides a sufﬁcient criterion
for DMT-optimality of an STBC-scheme, is rephrased here
with its statement consistent with the terminology used in
this paper.
Theorem 1: [4] For a quasi-static nt ×nr MIMO channel
with Rayleigh fading and perfect CSIR, an STBC-scheme
X that satisﬁes (1) is DMT-optimal for any value of nr
if for all possible pairs of distinct codewords X1 , X2 of
X (SN R), the difference matrix X1 − X2 = ∆X = O is
r
˙
such that det(∆X∆XH ) ≥ SN Rnt (1− nt ) .
Relying on Theorem 1, an explicit construction methodology was presented in [4] to obtain DMT-optimal LSTBCschemes whose LSTBCs are minimal-delay (T = nt ) and
obtained from cyclic division algebras (CDA). All these

Rate-nt LSTBC-schemes with the NVD property are
known to be DMT-optimal for arbitrary number of receive
antennas. The methods to construct such LSTBC-schemes
for arbitrary values of nt with minimal-delay (T = nt )
have been proposed in [4], [9] and such constructions with
additional properties have also been proposed for speciﬁc
number of transmit antennas - the perfect code-schemes
for 2, 3, 4 and 6 transmit antennas [8]. For the case
nr < nt , Corollary 1 establishes that a rate-nr LSTBCscheme with the NVD property achieves the optimal DMT
and the LSTBCs of such a scheme can make use of the
sphere decoder efﬁciently. Rate-nr LSTBC-schemes with
NVD can be obtained directly from the rate-nt LSTBCschemes with NVD as shown in the following corollary.

For the special case of nt being a power of 2, rate-1,
4-group decodable LSTBCs have been extensively studied
in literature (see [12], [13] and references therein). For
all these STBCs, the 2nt real symbols taking values from
PAM constellations can be separated into four equal groups
such that the symbols of each group can be decoded
independently of the symbols of all the other groups. For
these STBCs, the minimum determinant, irrespective of the
size of the signal constellation, is given by [13]

where dP,min is the minimum product distance in nt /2 real
dimensions, which has been shown to be a constant bounded
away from 0 in [22]. Hence, from Corollary 1, LSTBCschemes consisting of these 4-group decodable STBCs are
DMT-optimal for nt × 1 MIMO systems, with nt being a
power of 2 .
C. Fast-decodable STBCs
In [21] a rate-2 LSTBC was constructed for the 4 × 2
MIMO system and this code was conjectured to have a
minimum determinant of 10.24 when the real symbols take
values from regular M -PAM without regards to the value of
M . An interesting property of this LSTBC is that it allows
fast-decoding, meaning which, for ML-decoding the 16 real
symbols (or 8 complex symbols) of the STBC using sphere
decoding, it sufﬁces to use a 9 real-dimensional sphere
decoder instead of a 16 real-dimensional one. We conjecture
that the LSTBC-scheme based on this fast-decodable STBC
has the NVD property and hence is DMT-optimal for the
4 × 2 MIMO system.
Several rate-nr , fast-decodable STBCs have been constructed in [19] for various asymmetric MIMO conﬁgurations - for example, for 4 × 2, 6 × 2, 6 × 3, 8 × 2, 8 × 3, 8 × 4
MIMO systems. For an nt × nr asymmetric MIMO system,
these STBCs transmit a total of nt nr complex symbols
in nt channel uses and with regards to ML-decoding,
only an nt nr − nt complex-dimensional sphere decoder is
2
required, as against an nt nr complex-dimensional sphere
decoder required for decoding general rate-nr LSTBCs.
These STBCs are constructed from division algebra and
the STBC-schemes based on these STBCs have the NVD
property [19]. Hence, for an nt × nr asymmetric MIMO
system, LSTBC-schemes consisting of these rate-nr fastdecodable STBCs are DMT-optimal.
V. C ONCLUDING R EMARKS
In this paper, we have presented an enhanced sufﬁcient
criterion for the DMT-optimality of STBC-schemes using
which we have established the DMT-optimality of several
low ML-decoding complexity LSTBC-schemes for certain
