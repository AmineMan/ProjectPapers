own messages. Strictly higher achievable DoFs of 6/5 and
36/31 were then reported for these two channels respectively
in [7] and [8]. The DoF region of the two-user MIMO IC
with delayed CSIT was investigated in [9], [10]. Except for
the two-user MIMO IC whose DoF region with delayed CSIT
has been fully characterized, the DoF region or sum-DoF of
X channel with any number of users and interference channel
with more than two users are still unknown due to lack of
tight upper bounds. The best available achievable results on
the DoF of the general K-user SISO IC and X channel with
delayed CSIT can be found in [8].
In this paper, we investigate the two-user MIMO X channel
with delayed CSIT and with the same number of M antennas
at each transmitter and N antennas at each receiver. We
propose transmission schemes that achieve strictly higher sumDoF than one can achieve under the no CSIT assumption for
2M > N . We further show that our achievable DoF is tight for
all values of M and N except possibly for 1/2 < N/M < 4/3
by using the broadcast channel upper-bound developed in [3]
and [4].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The system
model is introduced in Section II. The main results are presented and discussed in Section III. The proof of the achievable
result is provided in Section IV. Finally, the paper is concluded
in Section V.

Abstract—The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian X channel in i.i.d. fading environment and with delayed
channel state information at transmitters (delayed CSIT) is
considered. It is assumed that each transmitter has M antennas
and each receiver has N antennas. New achievable results on the
sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of this channel are provided and
shown to be tight for all possible values of M and N except for
1/2 < N/M < 4/3. It is noteworthy that for certain values of M
and N , the channel DoF coincides with the DoF of the broadcast
channel obtained by assuming perfect transmitter cooperation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The growing demand for high data rate in communication
networks calls for efﬁcient utilization of shared media by
multiple users. The state-of-the-art interference management
techniques, such as interference alignment, require the availability of perfect and instantaneous channel state information
(CSI) at all transmitting nodes (full CSIT assumption) [1], [2].
However, the feasibility of this assumption is questionable if
the CSI varies very fast over a block of channel uses. This is
the case in high mobility environments where the CSI obtained
from the receivers through feedback links expires before being
exploited by the transmitters for the current transmission.
Nonetheless, a surprising result by Maddah-Ali and Tse
[3] showed that even in an i.i.d. fading environment, having
a completely outdated CSI at transmitters (delayed CSIT)
can signiﬁcantly improve the achievable rates compared to
having no CSIT at all. Focusing on multiple-input singleoutput (MISO) broadcast channels, they showed that this
improvement is even multiplicative, i.e., one can achieve
higher than only one degrees of freedom (DoF) which can
be achieved with no CSIT. The delayed CSIT model was then
studied for two-user and three-user MIMO broadcast channels
in [4], [5].
In another research direction, the impact of delayed CSIT
on the DoF of channels with distributed transmitters have been
ﬁrst studied in [6], where the authors obtained achievable
DoFs greater than 1 for two-user single-input single-output
(SISO) X channel and three-user SISO interference channel
(IC). The challenge in these channels is that, in contrast to
the broadcast channel, each transmitter has only access to its

A. The Two-User MIMO X Channel
An (M, N ) MIMO X channel, as depicted in Fig. 1, is
described by the following input-output relationship:
Y[j] (t) = H[j1] (t)X[1] (t) + H[j2] (t)X[2] (t) + Z[j] (t), (1)
where j ∈ {1, 2} is the receiver index, t, t = 1, 2, · · · , is the
time index, X[i] (t) ∈ CM is the transmitted vector of TXi ,
Y[j] (t) ∈ CN is the received vector at RXj , H[ji] (t) ∈ CN ×M
is the channel matrix between TXi and RXj , and Z[j] (t) ∈
CN is the complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
vector at RXj . The transmitters are required to satisfy the same
power constraint

We further assume that the channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d.
standard complex Gaussian random variables across time and
space and are independent of the receiver noise.

The proof of achievability is presented in section IV. The
converse proof is provided in the discussion.

In the X channel, there are four independent messages:
W11 , W12 , W21 , W22 , where Wij denotes a message from
TXi to RXj . A rate tuple (R11 (P ), R12 (P ), R21 (P ), R22 (P ))
is said to be achievable for the MIMO X channel if the
cardinality of each message set Wij , i, j ∈ {1, 2}, can be
increased as 2nRij (P ) with block length n and the average
probability of error for all messages can be made arbitrarily small when n is sufﬁciently large. The capacity region
CX (P ) of the MIMO X channel is the set of all achievable
rate tuples (R11 (P ), R12 (P ), R21 (P ), R22 (P )). A DoF tuple
(d11 , d12 , d21 , d22 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a rate
tuple (R11 (P ), R12 (P ), R21 (P ), R22 (P )) ∈ CX (P ) such that
Rij (P )
dij = limP →∞ log (P ) , i, j ∈ {1, 2}. The DoF region DX of
2
the MIMO X channel is the set of all achievable DoF tuples
(d11 , d12 , d21 , d22 ). The sum-DoF of this channel is deﬁned
as:

From [1] and [11], the sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel
with full CSIT is given by:

DoFX

max(d11 + d12 + d21 + d22 ).

max(M, N ) . (5)

On the other hand, it was shown in [12] that with no CSIT,
the sum-DoF of this channel collapses to:
DoFf-CSI (M, N ) = min 2 min(M, N ),
X

DoFn-CSI (M, N ) = min(2M, N ).

(6)

If we allow the transmitters in the MIMO X channel to
cooperate, we reach to a MIMO broadcast channel with 2M
antennas at the transmitter and N antennas at each receiver
whose DoF region with delayed CSIT was characterized in
[4] as:
d1
d2
+
≤ 1,
min(2M, 2N ) min(2M, N )
d1
d2
+
≤ 1.
min(2M, N ) min(2M, 2N )

(3)

(7)
(8)

Since cooperation cannot shrink the capacity region, the above
DoF region can serve as an outer-bound for the DoF region
of the MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT by just replacing
d1 by d11 + d12 and replacing d2 by d21 + d22 . From (7) and
(8), one can obtain the sum-DoF of the MIMO BC channel
with delayed CSIT which is an upper-bound for the sum-DoF
of the MIMO X channel:
4 min(2M, N ) min(M, N )
. (9)
DoFd-CSI (2M, N ) =
BC
min(2M, N ) + 2 min(M, N )

It is assumed that each receiver has access to its own
channel matrices perfectly and instantaneously while having other channel matrices with a unit delay. Moreover,
each transmitter knows all channel matrices perfectly but
with a unit delay. More precisely, at time index t, RXj ,
j ∈ {1, 2}, has access to {H[j1] (t ), H[j2] (t )}t =1 and
t
¯
¯
{H[j1] (t ), H[j2] (t )}t−1 , ¯ = {1, 2}\j, and TXi has access to
t =1 j
{H(t )}t−1
{H[11] (t ), H[12] (t ), H[21] (t ), H[22] (t )}t−1 .
t =1
t =1
The aforementioned assumptions about the CSI knowledge of
the transmitters and receivers will be referred to as delayed
CSIT. In the following, the sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel
with delayed CSIT will be denoted by DoFd-CSI . Also, the sumX
DoF of this channel with full and no CSIT will be denoted by
DoFf-CSI and DoFn-CSI , respectively.

Our achievable DoF results for the MIMO X channel with
delayed CSIT are summarized in Table I along with the
channel DoFs with full and no CSIT and also the broadcast
upper-bound (9). From the table, one can make the following
observations:

• For M < 2, delayed CSIT improves the channel sumDoF compared to the no CSIT case.

Phase I: This phase takes one channel use in which each
of TX1 and TX2 sends M independent information symbols
[k]
[k]
for RX1 . Let a1 , · · · , aM , k ∈ {1, 2}, denote the transmitted
symbols of TXk during Phase I. By the end of this phase,
RX1 has N equations in terms of 2M desired unknowns.
Since 2M > N , RX1 needs 2M − N extra equations to be
able to resolve its desired information symbols. Now, let us
look at the second receiver: RX2 has also N equations which
contain no information for RX2 , but, they can serve as the extra
equations RX1 needs in order to resolve its intended symbols.
Each of these N equations, however, is a linear combination
of information symbols of both transmitters, and therefore, can
not be locally generated at one transmitter. To overcome this
[2]
[2]
bottleneck, RX2 eliminates M variables a1 , · · · , aM from its
received equations∗ to obtain N − M linearly independent
[1]
[1]
equations which are solely in terms of a1 , · · · , aM . Let
[2]
[2]
J1 , · · · , JN −M denote these equations. RX2 can also elimi[1]
[1]
nate M variables a1 , · · · , aM to obtain N −M linearly inde[2]
[2]
pendent equations which are solely in terms of a1 , · · · , aM .
[2]
[2]
These equations are denoted by V1 , · · · , VN −M . Therefore,
from the N received equations at RX2 , 2(N − M ) equations
are formed† which are solely in terms of information symbols
of one transmitter. According to the delayed CSIT assumption,
[2]
[2]
TX1 has access to J1 , · · · , JN −M at the end of Phase I.
[2]
[2]
Similarly, TX2 has access to V1 , · · · , VN −M at the end of
Phase I. Since 2(N − M ) ≥ 2M − N , if we somehow deliver
[2]
[2]
[2]
[2]
any 2M − N of J1 , · · · , JN −M , V1 , · · · , VN −M to RX1 ,
it has enough equations to resolve its desired information
symbols. This goal will be achieved in Phase III.

For M ≤ 1 or M ≥ 4 , our achievable sum-DoF is tight

and characterize the channel sum-DoF. It is interesting to
note that the channel sum-DoF under the delayed CSIT
assumption lies strictly between channel sum-DoF with
full CSIT and channel sum-DoF with no CSIT. Also, for
these cases the sum-DoF of the X channel with delayed
CSIT coincides with sum-DoF of the BC obtained by
allowing cooperation between transmitters.
6
When M = N , our achievable DoF is equal to 5 N which
has been previously reported in [7].

In an independent work, the DoF of the MIMO X channel
with feedback and delayed CSIT has been characterized in
[13] . Comparing their results with Theorem 1 reveals that in
the presence of delayed CSIT, feedback can only increase DoF
N
for 1 < M < 4 . We do not know at this stage whether the
2
3
gap between the achieved DoF and the outer bound is due to
the weakness of the coding scheme or a new outer bound is
expected.

Phase II: This phase is similar to Phase I by exchanging the role of receivers. During this phase, each of TX1
and TX2 sends M information symbols for RX2 . Let
[1]
[1]
b1 , · · · , bM denote the information symbols transmitted by
[2]
[2]
TX1 and b1 , · · · , bM denote the information symbols trans[1]
[1]
mitted by TX2 . RX1 can eliminate the variables b1 , · · · , bM
from its received equations to obtain N − M equations
[1]
[1]
[2]
[2]
V1 , · · · , VN −M which are solely in terms of b1 , · · · , bM .
[2]
[2]
RX1 can also eliminate the variables b1 , · · · , bM from its
[1]
[1]
received equations to obtain N −M equations J1 , · · · , JN −M
[1]
[1]
which are solely in terms of b1 , · · · , bM . Since 2(N −
M ) ≥ 2M − N , if we somehow deliver any 2M − N
[1]
[1]
[1]
[1]
of J1 , · · · , JN −M , V1 , · · · , VN −M to RX2 , it has enough
equations to resolve its desired information symbols. This goal
will be achieved in Phase III.

IV. P ROOF OF T HEOREM 1
The common ingredient of our achievable scheme is to reconstruct the interfering signals of each receiver at transmitters
based on delayed CSIT, and re-transmit them. Retransmission
of interfering signals for both receivers can be done simultaneously, in order to achieve a higher DoF. We consider each
of the ﬁve cases in Theorem 1 separately:
a) 2 ≤

In this case, the channel DoFs with full and no CSIT
coincide and are equal to 2M . Therefore, the channel DoF
with delayed CSIT is also equal to 2M .

Our transmission scheme consists of three phases: Phase I
is dedicated to RX1 , i.e., in this phase, each transmitter sends
some information symbols desired by RX1 . In Phase II, which
is assigned to RX2 , each transmitter sends some information
symbols for RX2 . Finally, in Phase III, each transmitter sends
some redundant information to help both receivers to resolve
their desired symbols. In the following, we assume that a

according to the delayed CSIT assumption, it is available at
[1]
TX1 at the and of Phase II. Moreover, since J1 is available
[1]
[2]
at RX1 , if we deliver J1 + J1 to RX1 , it can eliminate
[1]
[2]
the effect of J1 to obtain J1 which is a useful equation
in terms of information symbols desired by RX1 . Similarly,
[1]
[2]
by delivering J1 + J1 to RX2 , it can eliminate the effect
[2]
[1]
of J1 to obtain J1 which is a useful equation in terms of
[1]
[2]
information symbols desired by RX2 . Therefore, J1 + J1
is a useful equation for both receivers. Since each receiver
only needs 2M − N extra equations to resolve its desired
symbols, our goal in Phase III is to deliver the 2M − N linear

antennas at each receiver and N < 2M , this can be simply
accomplished in 2M −N channel uses§ .

intended for RX2 in this phase by transmitting random linear
combinations of these symbols over its transmit antennas. Let
[2]
[2]
b1 , · · · , b3N −2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX2 during Phase II. From its received equations during Phase II, RX1
[2]
[2]
can eliminate 3N − 2M variables b1 , · · · , b3N −2M to obtain
[1]
[1]
2M − N equations which are solely in terms of b1 , · · · , b2M .
[1]

Let J1 , · · · , J2M −N denote these equations. RX1 can also

[1]
eliminate 2M variables b1 , · · · , b2M to obtain 2(N − M )
[2]
[2]
equations which are solely in terms of b1 , · · · , b3N −2M . Let
[1]

V1 , · · · , V2(N −M ) denote these equations. RX2 requires all
[1]

[1]

the linear combinations J1 , · · · , J2M −N , V1 , · · · , V2(N −M )
to resolve its desired symbols. This goal is achieved in Phase

Phase III: The linear combination J1 + J1 is solely
in terms of information symbols of TX1 and the channel
coefﬁcients in the ﬁrst and second channel uses. Therefore,
according to the delayed CSIT assumption, it is available
at TX1 at the and of Phase II. Moreover, if we deliver
[1]
[2]
J1 + J1 to both receivers, each of them will obtain a useful
equation in terms of its desired information symbols. Since
each receiver needs N extra equations to resolve its desired
symbols, our goal in Phase III is to deliver the N linear

[1]

combinations J1 + J1 , · · · , J2M −N + J2M −N , V1 + V1 ,

[2]

accomplished in one channel use§ .
Since 6N information symbols were transmitted in
2 + 2 + 1 = 5 channel uses, we have achieved a DoF of
6
5N.

Our transmission scheme for this case consists of three
phases as follows:
Phase I: This phase takes two channel uses. At each channel
use, TX1 sends M independent information symbols for RX1 .
[1]
[1]
Let a1 , · · · , a2M denote the transmitted symbols of TX1
during Phase I. TX2 sends 3N − 2M information symbols
intended for RX1 in this phase by transmitting random linear
combinations of these symbols over its transmit antennas.
N
Notice that since 1 < M < 4 we have 0 < 3N − 2M <
3
[2]
[2]
2M . Let a1 , · · · , a3N −2M denote the transmitted symbols of
TX2 during Phase I. By the end of Phase I, RX2 has 2N
equations in terms of 2M + 3N − 2M = 3N unknowns.
From this system of equations, RX2 can eliminate 3N − 2M
[2]
[2]
variables a1 , · · · , a3N −2M to obtain 2N − (3N − 2M ) =
2M − N independent equations which are solely in terms of
[1]
[1]
[2]
[2]
a1 , · · · , a2M . Let J1 , · · · , J2M −N denote these equations.
[1]
[1]
RX2 can also eliminate 2M variables a1 , · · · , a2M to obtain
2N − 2M = 2(N − M ) independent equations which are
[2]
[2]
[2]
[2]
solely in terms of a1 , · · · , a3N −2M . Let V1 , · · · , V2(N −M )
denote these equations. Thus, from the 2N received equations
at RX2 during Phase I, 2M − N + 2(N − M ) = N
independent equations are formed which are solely in terms
of information symbols of one transmitter. Since RX1 needs
3N − 2N = N extra equations to resolve its received symbols
during Phase I, we should deliver all the linear combinations
[2]
[2]
[2]
[2]
J1 , · · · , J2M −N , V1 , · · · , V2(N −M ) to RX1 . This goal is
accomplished in Phase III.

J1 , · · · , JM to RX1 and deliver V1 , · · · , VM to RX2 . Since

[2]
V1 , · · · , VM are available at both TX1 and RX2 and since

[1]
J1 , · · · , JM are available at both TX2 and RX1 , Phase III
will be accomplished in M channel uses† .
N
Since 2(2N + M ) information symbols were transmitted in
+M
2 + 2 + M = 4NN channel uses, we have achieved a DoF
N
2N
of M +4N (M + 2N ).

Since the MIMO interference channel is contained in the
MIMO X channel and the sum-DoF of the two-user MIMO
IC with M ≥ 2N is equal to 4 N (see [9] or [10]), we can

conclude that 3 N is also an achievable DoF for the MIMO X
channel.
V. C ONCLUSION
We obtained new results on the sum-DoF of the (M, N )
MIMO X channel with delayed CSIT. By developing new
coding schemes, we showed that there exist antenna conﬁgurations such that under the delayed CSIT assumption, the
sum-DoF of the MIMO X channel is equal to the sum-DoF
of the two-user MIMO BC which is obtained by allowing
cooperation between the two transmitters. We also proved that,
our achievable results are tight for all antenna conﬁgurations
N
except for the case of 1 < M < 4 .
