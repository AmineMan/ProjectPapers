attainable ef without constraining em and ed . These two values
correspond to the strongest protection for the special codeword
and that for regular codewords respectively, and are denoted
by Em and Ef .

Abstract—Single-message unequal error protection (UEP) is
a channel coding scheme that protects one special message
differently from other (regular) messages. This induces three
different types of errors in the system: 1) miss (where we decode
the special codeword as a regular codeword), 2) false alarm
(where we decode a regular codeword as the special codeword),
and 3) decoding error (where we decode a regular codeword
to another regular codeword). In this paper, we investigate the
fundamental limits of single-message UEP, in the context of
discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) without feedback. Similar
to Borade et al., we use error exponents as the performance
metric, and discuss maximizing the miss error exponent and
the false alarm error exponent, respectively. We provide a new
converse proof for the miss reliability function, i.e., the optimal
miss error exponent as a function of communication rate, and
extend the inner and outer bound results for the false alarm
reliability function in Borade et al. from rates close to capacity
to all rates up to capacity.

A. Related work
Some earlier information-theoretic analysis of singlemessage UEP is motivated by communication with delay
requirements, such as distributed control or streaming media
applications. In this setting, going beyond block coding, i.e.,
allowing non-blocking encoding schemes, improves performance. For example, one of the earliest work [1] uses a singlemessage UEP code in a variable-delay communication setting.
In [2], the authors consider delay in streaming communication
with noisy feedback, and use the special message in UEP as
an NACK signal. This achieves an error exponent that is much
higher than the traditional channel coding error exponent. In
a related work [3], error probability of the special message
is interpreted as “the best-case probability of (undetected)
block error across messages” and the miss exponent (called
hallucination exponent therein) “gives an upper bound on the
maximum probability of bit error in a non-blocking streaming
context where noiseless feedback is available and the destination is (occasionally) allowed to declare erasures.” There
the authors characterize the miss exponent Em for the binary
symmetric channel (BSC) at all rates up to capacity.
Another example application of UEP is frame synchronization. In [4], a slotted asynchronous channel model is proposed,
and the channel output induced by noise can be viewed as that
induced by a special codeword with repeated symbols. This
corresponds to a UEP problem with a design constraint on the
special message.
Finally, [5] provides a detailed introduction to the information theoretic perspectives of UEP and investigates the
fundamental limits of UEP on the discrete memoryless channel
(DMC). The authors characterize the miss exponent (red-alert
exponent therein) at capacity and provide lower and upper
bounds for the false alarm error exponent at capacity. In
addition, the miss error exponent for DMC at all rates up
to capacity is mentioned after [5, Lemma 1], and a proof is
given in [6, Theorem 34]. This result also follows from [7,
Lemma 1,Lemma 5]. Recently, [8] characterizes the miss error

I. I NTRODUCTION
Classical information theory assumes all messages are
equally important and protects them uniformly. However,
in certain communication scenarios it may be advantageous
to relax this uniformity assumption and to protect certain
information more than others, which leads to the framework of
unequal error protection (UEP). In this paper we investigate the
fundamental limits of single-message unequal error protection,
the problem of protecting a special codeword differently from
other regular codewords in the codebook.
This codeword classiﬁcation leads naturally to three different types of errors in the system: 1) miss (where we
decode the special codeword as a regular codeword), 2)
false alarm (where we decode a regular codeword as the
special codeword), and 3) decoding error (where we decode a
regular codeword to another regular codeword). We denote
the probabilities of these three events by Pm , Pf and Pd
respectively. In most applications, we are interested in the
regime that Pm , Pf and Pd can be made arbitrarily small by
increasing the codeword block length n. Given this reliability
condition, we can deﬁne the error exponents em , ef and ed for
these three probabilities, which tell us asymptotically how fast
these error probabilities decay as the codeword block length
increases. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the maximal attainable

In this paper, we further investigate the problem of singlemessage unequal error protection for the general DMC in the
absence of feedback. We provide a new converse proof for the

we provide lower and upper bounds for the false alarm error
exponent at all rates up to capacity, and both bounds match
the results at capacity in [5]. All results are obtained via a few
generalizations of standard results in the method of types [9].
II. N OTATIONS AND P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
A. Notations
This paper uses lower case letters (e.g., x) to denote a
particular value of the corresponding random variable, which
is denoted in capital letters (e.g., X). A vector is denoted by its
length as a superscript (e.g., xn ). Calligraphic fonts (e.g., X )
represent a set and P (X ) denotes all probability distributions
on the alphabet X . Z+ and Z+ denote the set of non-negative
integers . and the set of positive integers respectively. We
deﬁne ≤ in the exponential sense, i.e., for a sequence an ,
.
.
.

an ≤ enF ⇔ F ≥ limn→∞ n log an , and we deﬁne ≥ and =
similarly.
We deﬁne the index set of a certain element a in a sequence
xn by

ˆ
Pxn ,yn (a, b) − Pxn (a)W (b|a) ≤ δ.
A constant composition code is a code whose codewords all
have the same type, i.e., lie in the same type class.
Finally, we extend the notion of typical shell and deﬁne the
tightly typical shell with respect to a sequence xn as
˚n
T[W ]δ (xn )

We follow the standard deﬁnition of the discrete memoryless
channel (DMC) W : X → Y, which has input alphabet X =
{1, 2, . . . , |X |} and output alphabet Y = {1, 2, . . . , |Y|}. The
conditional distribution of output letter Y when the channel
input letter X equals x ∈ X is denoted by WY |X (·|x):
WY |X (y|x) = P [Y = y | X = x]

∀ x ∈ X , ∀ y ∈ Y.

When the input and output alphabets are clear from context,
W is used instead of WY |X . Also, for simplicity, we denote
Wx W ( · | x).
In this paper, we only consider the case that the support of
W ( · | x) is Y for all x ∈ X , i.e., for any x ∈ X and any
y ∈ Y, W ( y | x) > 0, because the analysis for other cases is
either simple or can be reduced to this case.
For a DMC, a length n block code with input alphabet
X , output alphabet Y and some ﬁnite message set Mfn =
{0, 1, 2, . . . , |Mfn |} is composed of a pair of mappings,
encoder mapping fn : Mfn → X n and decoder mapping
gn : Y n → Mfn . Given a message m, the encoder maps it to
a sequence xn (m) ∈ X n and transmits this sequence through
the channel, where we call xn (m) the codeword for message
m and the entire set of codewords {xn (m), m ∈ Mfn } a
codebook. The receiver receives a sequence y n ∈ Y n , where
n
W n ( y n | xn (m))
i=1 W ( yi | xi (m)). We denote (fn , gn )
by C (n) .
In the context of unequal error protection, we use message
0 to denote the special message and refer to the collection of regular codewords as the regular codebook. We use
An ∪m=0 g −1 (m) to denote the decoding region for regular
−1
codewords and use Bn
gn (m = 0) to denote decoding
region for the special codeword. If y n ∈ An , we consider

The performance of a codebook over a channel W can
be characterized by three types of error: 1) miss, where we
decode a special codeword as a regular codeword; 2) false

codeword; 3) decoding error, where we decode a regular
codeword incorrectly into another regular codeword. Formally,
we deﬁne

The most general problem—characterization of the achievable error exponent region E(R)—is open and this paper
focuses on the false alarm and miss errors by putting no
constraints on ed . In particular, this paper investigates the
reliability functions for false alarm and miss errors:
Deﬁnition 3 (Reliability functions). For a DMC (X , Y, W ),
given a rate R, we deﬁne the miss reliability function and the
false alarm reliability function as

In addition, we deﬁne the rate of a code C (n) as R(C (n) )
log |Mfn | /n. For a sequence of codebooks Q = {C (n) , n ∈
Z+ }, we deﬁne its rate as RQ = lim inf n→∞ R(C (n) ). When
the codebook sequence is clear from context, we denote

Pd C (n) , Pm C (n) and Pf C (n) by Pd , Pm and Pf ,

The converse argument to Theorem 1 is implied by a
converse proof for UEP with feedback in [6]. Below we
present the sketch of an alternative converse proof, based on
a few generalizations of the method of types.
In the method of types, it is known that for every reliable
channel code, there exists a constant composition subcode
with essentially the same rate [9, Collrollary 6.3 and Exercise
6.19]. Lemma 3 below shows that a similar argument holds
when we replace constant composition code by a code whose
subsequences are constant composition.

In this section we investigate the false alarm reliability
function of a DMC (X , Y, W ). We start with the case of a
special codeword consisting of a repeated symbol, then extend
the results to an unconstrained special codeword. Unlike the
case of miss detection, the exact characterization of the false
alarm reliability function is open, but we are able to provide
inner and outer bounds.

blocks, we design the encoding and decoding schemes below.
Denote each message m by a |X |-tuple (i1 , i2 , . . . , i|X | ),
where ib ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , |Cb |} , b ∈ X . Then we deﬁne the
following encoding and decoding functions for C (n) = (f, g):

g (y n ) = ˆ1 , ˆ2 , . . . , ˆ|X |
