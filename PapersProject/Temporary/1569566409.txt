This paper studies the fundamental tradeoff between these
two information efﬁciencies, with particular emphasis on the
behavior of cd at high photon efﬁciency ip .
Since electromagnetic waves are fundamentally governed by
the laws of quantum mechanics, the maximum possible rate
of reliable communication at optical wavelengths is ultimately
limited by the Holevo capacity [1]. On a pure-loss channel
without background radiation, the Holevo bound on achievable
pairs (ip , id ) can be written parametrically [2]:

Abstract—Coherent states achieve the Holevo capacity of a
pure-loss channel when paired with an optimal measurement,
but a physical realization of this measurement is unknown,
and likely to be of high complexity. In this paper, we focus
on the photon-counting measurement and study the photon
and dimensional efﬁciencies attainable with modulations over
classical- and nonclassical-state alphabets. We ﬁrst review stateof-the-art coherent on-off-keying (OOK) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) with a photon-counting measurement, illustrating
its asymptotic inefﬁciency relative to the Holevo limit. Then we
analyze two architectures that improve upon the dimensional
versus photon efﬁciency tradeoff achievable with conventional
OOK or PPM. We show that at high photon efﬁciency these
architectures achieve an efﬁciency tradeoff that differs from
the best possible tradeoff by only a constant factor. The ﬁrst
architecture is a coherent-state transmitter that relies on feedback
from the receiver to control the transmitted energy. The second
architecture uses a single-photon number-state source.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We characterize the performance of optical communications
systems by their efﬁciency in utilizing available resources
to transmit information. The resources of interest are the
transmitted power and the bandwidth occupancy, or, more
generally, the number of dimensions (temporal, spatial, or
polarization) occupied by the signal. Let n denote the mean

channel use (the number of dimensions required to span the
collection of possible transmitted symbols per channel use),
and C(¯ , D) the channel capacity, the maximum rate of

constraints. We deﬁne the photon information efﬁciency (PIE)

The Shannon capacities of optical systems using conventional modulation and receiver strategies are bounded away
from the ultimate Holevo capacity. In other words, conventional systems cannot achieve the best possible tradeoff of cd
versus ip . In this paper, we show how conventional systems using on-off keying (OOK) or pulse-position modulation (PPM)
together with a photon-counting receiver can be redesigned (in
principle) to bridge some of the gap to the Holevo limit. One
new strategy utilizes a coherent-state transmitter that relies on
idealized, delayless, cost-free feedback from the receiver to
the transmitter to shut off the transmitted pulse as soon as
a single photon is detected. A second strategy uses a singlephoton number state instead of a coherent state to represent
an “on” pulse in either OOK or PPM modulation. The latter
architecture is sensitive to losses in the propagation path, and
approaches the Holevo capacity only in the near ﬁeld when the
transmitter-to-receiver coupling is high. The ﬁrst architecture
can be regarded as a method to emulate the statistics of a
single-photon number state at the receiver, while maintaining
the propagation efﬁciency of coherent states.

Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract

We ﬁrst consider coherent-state OOK and PPM modulations
paired with an ideal photon counting receiver. Implementations

1

of these architectures have achieved the highest photon efﬁciencies demonstrated to date. They also serve as a baseline
for the systems that follow.
The on-off photon-counting channel is modeled as follows.
In one slot of duration T seconds, we receive either a pulse
with photon ﬂux equal to λ (expressed in units of photons/sec),
or no pulse, i.e., a photon ﬂux equal to 0. With OOK modulation a given slot contains a nonzero pulse with probability
p, and with M -ary PPM exactly one slot of each block of M
slots contains a nonzero pulse. The mean photon cost n per
¯
channel use is nOOK = pλT for OOK and nPPM = λT /M
¯
¯
for M -ary PPM. In both cases, the photon ﬂux is incident
on an ideal inﬁnite-bandwidth photon-counting photodetector,
and the transmission bandwidth may be taken to be B = 1/T .
The dimensional cost D of a channel use, the time-bandwidth
product, is DOOK = DPPM = BT = 1.
In the absence of background, the output of the photodetector during a given slot time is a Poisson point process with
rate either λ or 0. Since in this case detection of a single
photon is sufﬁcient to unambiguously resolve whether a pulse
was transmitted, the channel output may be classiﬁed into a
binary outcome: either no detection event occurs or at least
one detection event occurs. This produces a Z-channel for
OOK, and an M -ary erasure channel for M -ary PPM. The
Z-channel’s crossover probability and the erasure channel’s
erasure probability are both given by e−λT = 1 − , where
is deﬁned to be the probability that at least one photon is
detected during time T given that the incident photon ﬂux is λ.
The photon and dimensional efﬁciencies for the OOK
channel can be written succinctly as [3]

Comparing this expression to the Holevo-optimal tradeoff, we
see that at large ip :

Thus, conventional OOK and PPM both achieve a DIE that
has suboptimal asymptotic dependence on PIE at large ip ,
relative to the Holevo-optimal tradeoff. The gap between the
optimal DIE and that achieved by standard OOK or PPM
grows linearly with increasing PIE.

Next we consider a conceptual modiﬁcation to OOK or
PPM systems that conventionally use coherent-state pulses.
Since detection of a single photon in any slot is sufﬁcient
to identify whether a pulse was transmitted in that slot, any
additional detection events are wasted in the sense that they
convey no additional information. Hence, if the transmitter
knew the instant a photon were detected at the receiver, it could
stop transmitting during the current slot time, thus reducing
the photon cost with no change in the channel’s capacity.
An idealized receiver structure that performs this operation
is illustrated in Fig. 1, in which the receiver provides delayless and noise-free feedback to the transmitter, informing it to
terminate the transmitted pulse as soon as the ﬁrst photon is
detected. If no photons are detected, either because the vacuum
state was transmitted or because an erasure event occurred, the
receiver waits until the end of the T -second window and then
restarts anew. We refer to such a system as OOK or PPM with
single-photon shutoff, and we use the shorthand notation “1S”
in referring to its variables in the following analysis.

For this architecture, the OOK or PPM channel is modeled
by the same Z channel or erasure channel as that used
for conventional pulses without early shutoff. The channel’s
crossover or erasure probability 1 − is unchanged in terms
of the photon ﬂux λ, and the mutual information between
input and output does not change as a function of λ. However,
now the early transmitter shutoff reduces the average photon
usage needed to communicate the same information. Whereas
with conventional schemes the mean photon usage in a nonvacuum slot is λT , now it is λ¯, where τ < T is the mean

This increase in photon efﬁciency does not come for free.
First, the feedback channel requires additional resources,
which are not accounted for here, but ignoring these costs
might be appropriate for a link with very asymmetric forward
and backward link capabilities. More fundamentally, there is
increased bandwidth usage on the forward link, which results
from the same shortened pulse durations that reduce the mean
photon usage. Heuristically, the bandwidth usage is roughly
1/T if λT is small, such that pulses are hardly ever shut off
before the end of a slot, and is roughly λ if λT is large, such
that the mean pulse duration is roughly 1/λ. More generally,
the bandwidth usage may be estimated as the reciprocal of the
average duration of a pulse, τ = T /d( ). With this deﬁnition2

We have an asymptotic expression at large PIE [3]:

(1)

The optimal ∗ at high PIE corresponds to λT ≈ 2.087,
implying that the optimal photon ﬂux in a pulsed slot would
cost 2.087 photons if the transmission continued for the
entire symbol duration T . The single-photon shutoff strategy
reduces the mean photon cost in a pulsed slot to 0.876 at
the expense of an increase in spectral occupancy by a factor
of d( ∗ ) ≈ 2.383, and this trade nets a signiﬁcantly better
DIE at high PIE. Conversely, at low PIE, the DIE achieved
by OOK with single-photon shutoff is worse than that of
conventional OOK. In this regime, the PIE-DIE tradeoff is
hurt by the increase in bandwidth usage more than it is
helped by the reduction in mean photon usage. The tradeoff is
favorable only when the log-domain curve deﬁned by the pair
of points (log2 ip , log2 id ) has slope less than −1. Numerical
evaluation of cOOK/1S (ip ) is illustrated in Fig. 2, showing

that OOK with single-photon shutoff yields better DIE than
conventional OOK when PIE exceeds 2.22 bits/photon, and
the improvement becomes signiﬁcant at higher PIE.

Since the corresponding time-bandwidth product for conventional OOK or PPM is DOOK = DPPM = 1, we see that the
single-photon shutoff scheme increases bandwidth usage by
the same factor d( ) by which mean photon usage is reduced.
Since the channel models for OOK and PPM with singlephoton shutoff are unchanged from their respective models
with conventional pulses, the corresponding photon and dimensional information efﬁciencies of the single-photon shutoff
scheme increase or decrease by the same factors relative to the

Unlike conventional OOK or PPM, the asymptotic dimensional efﬁciency of OOK or PPM with single-photon shutoff
has the same parametric dependence as the optimal Holevo
bound. The asymptotic DIE is inferior to the ultimate quantum
limit by a constant multiplicative factor (0.274 for OOK or
0.150 for PPM), whereas the asymptotic DIE of conventional
OOK or PPM is inferior to the ultimate quantum limit by a
factor that increases linearly in ip .

A single-mode ideal optical channel can be modeled as a
beamsplitter of transmissivity η, where η represents the endto-end efﬁciency with which the state is transmitted to the
photodetector, including transmitter optical losses, diffraction
loss and absorption, the receiver optical efﬁciency, and the
photodetector quantum efﬁciency. In the limit η → 1, the
Holevo capacity can be achieved by transmitting a numberstate alphabet {|n : n = 0, 1, . . . } with a geometric probability distribution, and receiving the signal with an ideal photoncounting receiver [5]. In this paper, we analyze how closely
this approach to the Holevo capacity can be maintained when
we use only a binary alphabet {|0 , |1 } and allow η < 1.
For this scheme, the transmitter sends either the vacuum
state |0 or the pure single-photon number state |1 . The
single-photon number state is transmitted with probability p
for OOK, and in exactly one of M successive channel uses
for PPM. When the transmitter ﬁeld mode is in the vacuum
state, then the output of the beamsplitter is also in a vacuum
state. When the transmitter ﬁeld mode is in the single-photon
number state, then the output ﬁeld mode is in a mixed state
η|1 1| + (1 − η)|0 0|. Hence, an ideal photon counting
photodetector yields the conditional output probabilities:

Fig. 3(a) illustrates dimensional efﬁciency versus photon efﬁciency for OOK with number states for several values of η.
Fig. 3(b) shows the variation of the asymptotic penalty factor
2−h2 (η) , relative to the Holevo limit, as a function of η (solid
curve). For small η, this is approximately η/e (red dashed
line). From (1) and (2), we see that at η ≈ 0.534 (for which
2−h2 (η) ≈ 0.274), OOK with number states achieves the same
asymptote at high photon efﬁciency as OOK with singlephoton shutoff. OOK with number states is always superior to
conventional OOK using coherent states (with no early shutoff)
at high enough PIE, but the crossover point moves to higher
values of PIE as η degrades. If η = 0.1, this crossover point
is at approximately 10 bits/photon.
The information efﬁciencies for number-state PPM are:
ip = iPPM/1NS = log2 M
p

id = iPPM/1NS = η

and the capacity efﬁciency tradeoff is:

d

d

Pr count = 1 |1 sent = η

Pr count = 0 |1 sent = 1 − η

Hence, both OOK and PPM with single-photon number
states achieve the same asymptotic dependence as the ultimate
efﬁciency, except for constant penalty factors independent
of ip . The asymptotic penalty factor for number-state PPM,
η/e, equals that of number-state OOK in the small-η limit
(red dashed line in Fig. 3(b)). Unlike the penalty factors for
OOK and PPM with single-photon shutoff, the penalties for
OOK and PPM with single-photon number states depend on
another parameter, the channel transmissivity η.
Since the efﬁciencies of the single-photon number-state
modulations depend on the channel losses, we brieﬂy discuss
the typical power coupling that can be achieved in a nearﬁeld link geometry [6]. If soft Gaussian apertures are used
at the transmitter and receiver, the Fresnel number product is
2 2
DF = π 2 rT rR /(4λ2 L2 ), where λ0 is the center wavelength,
0
L is the propagation distance, and rT , rR are the e−1 amplitude attenuation radii of the transmitter and receiver apertures.

For OOK the channel reduces to a Z-channel with crossover
probability 1 − η, and for M -ary PPM it is an erasure channel
with erasure probability 1 − η. We denote variables pertaining
to this architecture with the superscript “1NS”.
The Z-channel and erasure channel capacities are equivalent
to those derived for their counterparts for coherent-state OOK
and PPM with single-photon shutoff, with replaced by the
channel transmissivity η. Furthermore, the average number
of photons n counted by the receiver is nOOK/1NS = pη for
¯

OOK, or nPPM/1NS = η/M for PPM,3 which are the exact

counterparts of the corresponding expressions for n for OOK

by η. It follows that the photon and dimensional information

background, the DIE achievable with this scheme is inferior
to the Holevo limit by a factor that grows linearly with
PIE. We investigated two methods to improve the efﬁciencies
achievable with a photon-counting receiver. Each signiﬁcantly
improves on conventional OOK or PPM at large PIE and
achieves the same parametric dependence as the Holevo limit,
such that the degradation relative to the Holevo limit is a
constant factor at large PIE. However, each scheme requires
assumptions that make a practical implementation challenging.
Our ﬁrst approach, OOK or PPM with single-photon shutoff, is conceptual and not at all practical. As presented, it
requires a perfect feedback channel with no latency, and,
moreover, we assess no cost to the feedback channel. However,
its impracticality should not overshadow a fundamental insight
offered by this architecture: the asymptotic suboptimality of
conventional OOK or PPM with photon-counting is essentially
due to continued energy transmission that does not contribute
to information transfer after the ﬁrst photon is detected at
the receiver. If the transmitter could shut itself off (via either
ideal feedback or an oracle) at the instant when the receiver
detects the ﬁrst photon in a slot, the energy conserved from
shutting off the transmitter is sufﬁcient to achieve a DIE which
is suboptimal relative to the Holevo limit by only a constant
factor at high PIE (0.274 for OOK or 0.150 for PPM).
Our second approach requires us to transmit number states,
{|0 , |1 }, rather than coherent states. This architecture inherently pushes the complexity to the transmitter by requiring ondemand generation of a (nonclassical) single-photon number
state in a deﬁned spatiotemporal and polarization mode, in
addition to requiring efﬁcient transfer of this state from the
transmitter to the receiver. Single-photon number-state generation is an area of active research [7]. If such a source were
available, the DIE would be suboptimal by only a constant
factor, in this case 2−h2 (η) for OOK or η/e for PPM. This
factor now depends on the end-to-end efﬁciency, η, with which
the number state is transmitted to the photodetector. Achieving
a reasonable transmission efﬁciency is not trivial, but may
become feasible with improving device technologies.
