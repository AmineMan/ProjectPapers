nodes and E is the set of links. In this work, we assume that
G is a two-unicast network with rate (1,2), i.e., G has two
source-sink pairs {s1 , t1 } and {s2 , t2 }. The source s1 wishes
to communicate a message X1 to the sink t1 and the source s2
wishes to communicate two messages X2 and X3 to the sink
t2 , where Xi , i = 1, 2, 3, are independent random variables
taking values from a ﬁxed ﬁnite ﬁeld F. A link e = (u, v) can
transmit one symbol, i.e., one element of the ﬁeld F, from
node u to v per transmission.
As in [1], we assume that the source s1 has one virtual
incoming link, called the X1 source link, and the source s2
has two virtual incoming links, called the X2 source link and
X3 source link respectively. Correspondingly, the sink t1 has
a virtual outgoing link, called the X1 sink link and the sink t2
has two virtual outgoing links, called the X2 sink link and X3
sink link respectively. A link e is called a source (sink) link if
it is a virtual incoming (outgoing) link of the sources (sinks).
If e is not a source link, we call e a non-source link.
For a link e = (u, v), u is called the tail of e and v is called
the head of e, and are denoted by u = tail(e) and v = head(e),
respectively. For two links e, e′ ∈ E, we call e′ an incoming
link of e (e an outgoing link of e′ ) if tail(e) = head(e′ ). For
any e ∈ E, denoted by In(e) the set of incoming links of
e. We assume that In(e) ̸= ∅ if e ∈ E is not the source link.
Otherwise, e has no impact on the network communication and
can be removed from G. Note that G = (V, E) is acyclic, in
this paper, we always assume that E is sequentially indexed
as E = {e1 , e2 , e3 , · · · , e|E| } such that ei is the Xi source
link, i = 1, 2, 3 and i < j if ei is an incoming link of ej .
Let A, B ⊆ V and S ⊆ E. S is called an A-B cut if
there is no directed path from any vertex in A to any vertex
in B in the graph G \ S. Deﬁne the mincut from A to B by
c(A; B) := min{|S|; S is an A-B cut}, where |S| is the size
of S. For v1 , v2 ∈ V , we denote v1 → v2 if there is a path in
G from v1 to v2 . Else, we denote v1
v2 .
For i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, denote αi the vector of F3 with the ith
component being 1 and all the other components being 0. For
Ψ ⊆ F3 , denote ⟨Ψ⟩ the subspace of F3 spanned by Ψ.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Linear Network Code [1]): A linear network code (LNC) of G over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a collection
of vectors C = {de ∈ F3 ; e ∈ E ′ } such that

Abstract—We consider a directed acyclic network with two
source-sink pairs {s1 , t1 } and {s2 , t2 }. The source s1 wishes to
communicate a message X1 to the sink t1 and the source s2 wishes
to communicate two messages X2 and X3 to the sink t2 , where
Xi , i = 1, 2, 3, are independent random variables of unit rate.
We give a simple characterization for linear solvability of such
networks under the condition that the minimum cut from {s1 , s2 }
to t2 equals 3. We develop a region decomposition method for
proving this result, which we believe can be an effective approach
for non-multicast network coding problem.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Multi-source multi-sink (non-multicast) network coding is a
well known open problem[1]. It has shown that characterizing
the solvability of a general non-multicast network is a difﬁcult
task [2]. The multiple-unicast problem is of great interest
for non-multicast network coding studies [3], [4]. Dougherty
and Zeger proved that any ﬁnite directed acyclic network is
CSLS-equivalent to a multiple-unicast network [5]. Some outer
bounds on the achievable rate-region for the multiple-unicast
problem were presented in [6], [7]. However, it remains open
to give an exact characterization for the solvability of general
multiple-unicast problems except the two-unicast case with
rate (1,1)[8],[9].
In this paper, we consider the two-unicast network coding
problem with rate (1,2), i.e., one source (s1 ) wishes to communicate a message X1 to one sink (t1 ) and the other source (s2 )
wishes to communicate two messages X2 and X3 to another
sink (t2 ). We give a necessary and sufﬁcient condition on
the linear solvability under the condition that the maximum
ﬂow from {s1 , s2 } to t2 is 3. To this end, we develop a
region decomposition approach in the spirt of the information
ﬂow decomposition approach proposed by C. Fragouli and
E. Soljanin [10]. We believe that the region decomposition
approach can be a useful method for non-multicast network
coding problem [9].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the basic notion and the region decomposition method.
In Section III, the region decomposition method is further
developed. The main result is presented in Section IV, and
the paper is concluded in Section V.
II. P RELIMINARIES

(1) If e is the Xi source link or the Xi sink link (i ∈
{1, 2, 3}), then de = αi ;
(2) If e is not a source link, then de ∈ ⟨{de′ ; e′ ∈ In(e)}⟩.

A. Model and Basic Notion
Consider a communication network modeled as a ﬁnite,
directed, acyclic graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of

Since G is acyclic, it is easy to see that RG(D) is acyclic. A path from R0 to Rk , denoted lR0 →Rk is a subset
{R0 , R1 , · · · , Rk } ⊆ D such that Ri−1 is a parent of Ri . For
R, Q ∈ D, we denote R → Q if there is a path from R to Q.
Else, we denote R
Q.
Deﬁnition 2.4 (Codes on Region Graph): Let D be a nonsingular region decomposition of G. A linear network code
(LNC) of RG(D) over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a collection of
¯
vectors C = {dR ∈ F3 ; R ∈ D} such that
(1) dSi = dTi = αi (i = 1, 2, 3);
(2) If R is a non-source region, then dR ∈ ⟨{dP ; P ∈
In(R)}⟩.
The vector dR is called the global encoding vector of R.
The region graph RG(D) is said to be linearly solvable if it
has a linear network code over some ﬁnite ﬁeld F.
Clearly, an LNC of RG(D) can be extended to an LNC
of G. Thus if RG(D) is linearly solvable then the original
network G is linearly solvable.
As in [9], we have an O(|E|) time algorithm (See Fig. 2) to
obtain a special region decomposition, namely D1 of G such
that G is linearly solvable if and only if RG(D1 ) is linearly
solvable and each non-source region has at least two parents.
In what follows, we will always use D1 to denote the region
decomposition obtained by algorithm 1.

B. Region Decomposition

Rj = {ej };

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Region Decomposition): Let R be a nonempty subset of E. R is called a region of G if there is a
e0 ∈ R such that any e ∈ R \ {e0 } has an incoming link
in R. Meanwhile, e0 is called the head of R and is denoted
by e0 = head(R). If E is partitioned into mutually disjoint
regions, say R1 , · · · , Rn , we call D = {R1 , · · · , Rn } a region
decomposition of G.
Let D be a region decomposition of G and R ∈ D. For
i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, R is called the Xi source region if head(R) is
the Xi source link; R is called the Xi sink region if R contains
the Xi sink link; R is called an Xi region if R is the Xi source
region or the Xi sink region. R is called a singular region if
R is both an Xi region and an Xj region for some i ̸= j.
D is called a singular region decomposition if it contains a
singular region; otherwise, it is called nonsingular.
Convention: All the Xi source (sink) regions are called
source (sink) regions. The other regions are called coding
regions. The terminology non-source region refers to a region
which is not a source region.
Let D be a region decomposition of G and {R, R′ } ⊆ D.
We say that R′ is a parent of R (R a child of R′ ) if
In(head(R)) ∩ R′ ̸= ∅, i.e., head(R) has an incoming link
in R′ . Denoted by In(R) the set of parents of R.
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Region Graph): Let D be a region decomposition of G. The region graph with respect to D, denoted
by RG(D), is a directed, simple graph with vertex set D and
edge set {(R′ , R) ∈ D2 ; R′ is a parent of R}.

n = 3;
j ← from 4 to |E|
if there is an i ∈ {1, · · · , n} such that In(ej ) ⊆ Ri then

Ri = Ri ∪ {ej };
else

n = n + 1;
Rn = {ej };
end if
return D1 = {R1 , · · · , Rn };

Fig 2. Region decomposing: This algorithm is based on the fact that E can
be sequentially indexed as E = {e1 , e2 , e3 , · · · , e|E| } such that ei is the
Xi source link, i = 1, 2, 3 and i < j if ei is an incoming link of ej .

Example 2.5: By Algorithm 1, we can decompose the network G1 in Fig. 1 with R1 = {e1 , (s1 , v3 ), (s1 , v7 ), (s1 , v10 )},
R2 = {e2 }, R3 = {e3 }, R4 = {(s2 , v1 ), (v1 , v3 ), (v1 , v4 )},
R5 = {(s2 , v2 ), (v2 , v4 )}, R6 = {(v3 , v5 ), (v5 , v7 ), (v5 , v11 )},
R7 = {(v4 , v6 ), (v6 , v9 ), (v6 , v11 )}, R8 = {(v7 , v8 ), (v8 , v9 ),
(v8 , t2 )}, R9 = {(v9 , t1 ), (t1 , v10 ), (t1 , v11 ), (t1 , t2 ), e4 },
R10 = {(v10 , v11 )}, R11 = {(v11 , t2 )}, R12 = {e5 }, R13 =
{e6 }. Then D1 = {R1 , · · · , R13 } is a nonsingular region
decomposition of G1 , where R1 , R2 , R3 are the X1 , X2 , X3
source region and R9 , R12 , R13 are the X1 , X2 , X3 sink region
respectively. The region graph RG(D1 ) is shown in Fig. 3.

on the fact that D can be sequentially indexed as D = {R1 , · · · , Rn } such

Step 1: We prove that there exist W1 , W2 ∈ D such
that {W1 , W2 } ⊆ reg(R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg(Q1 , Q2 ) and W1 , W2 ∈
/
reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ). Consider the following two
cases:
Case 1: reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ) = ∅. It is obviously.
Case 2: reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ) ̸= ∅. Since RG(D)
is ﬁnite, there exists at least one region, say W , in
reg◦ (R1 , R2 )∩reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ) such that no parent of W belongs
to reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ). Let {W1 , W2 } ⊆ In(W ).
Then {W1 , W2 } ⊆ reg(R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg(Q1 , Q2 ) and W1 , W2 ∈
/
reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ).
Step 2: We prove that reg(R1 , R2 ) ⊆ reg(Q1 , Q2 ) or
reg(Q1 , Q2 ) ⊆ reg(R1 , R2 ). In step 1, we have proven
that there are two regions W1 , W2 such that {W1 , W2 } ⊆
reg(R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg(Q1 , Q2 ) and W1 , W2 ∈ reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ∩
/
reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ). We have the following three cases.
Case 1: {W1 , W2 } = {R1 , R2 }. For this case,
reg(R1 , R2 ) ⊆ reg(Q1 , Q2 ).
Case 2: {W1 , W2 } = {Q1 , Q2 }. For this case,
reg(Q1 , Q2 ) ⊆ reg(R1 , R2 ).
Case 3: W1 ∈ {R1 , R2 } ∩ reg◦ (Q1 , Q2 ) and W2 ∈
{Q1 , Q2 } ∩ reg◦ (R1 , R2 ). Since each non-source region has
at least 2 parents, by Deﬁnition 3.1, we can easily ﬁnd a path
from W1 to W2 and a path from W2 to W1 , which contradicts
to the fact that RG(D) is acyclic.
By the above discussion, the result follows.
Corollary 3.4: For any two different 2-dimensional regions
ΠR1 ,R2 and ΠQ1 ,Q2 , |ΠR1 ,R2 ∩ ΠQ1 ,Q2 | ≤ 1.
Corollary 3.5: Let |In(R)| = 2. Then there exists an
unique 2-dimensional region ΠU1 ,U2 such that R ∈ Π◦ 1 ,U2 .
U
Theorem 3.3, Corollary 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 establish the
basic properties of the super regions of a region graph. (In
fact, we have developed more relations on the super regions,
due to the space limitation, we omit them.)

III. T WO - DIMENSIONAL R EGION
The region decomposition method can be used to characterize the solvability of 2-simple multicast networks [9]. However, to characterize the solvability of the 2-unicast network with
rate (1,2), further development of the region decomposition
method is need. First, we give the following deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Super Region): Let ∅ = Θ ⊆ D. The super
̸
region generated by Θ, is a subset reg(Θ) of D satisﬁes:
(1) Θ ⊆ reg(Θ);
(2) For any R ∈ D, if In(R) ⊆ reg(Θ), then R ∈ reg(Θ).
Since RG(D) is acyclic, reg(Θ) is well deﬁned. Denote
reg◦ (Θ) = reg(Θ) \ Θ, and reg(Θ) = reg(R1 , · · · , Rk ) if
Θ = {R1 , · · · , Rk }.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (2-dimensional Region): Let {R1 , R2 } ⊆ D
and reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ̸= ∅. reg(R1 , R2 ) is called a 2-dimensional
region of RG(D) if for any {Q1 , Q2 } ⊆ D, reg(R1 , R2 ) ⊆
reg(Q1 , Q2 ) implies {R1 , R2 } = {Q1 , Q2 }.
Convention: To differentiate with the general super regions, in the following, we denote a 2-dimensional region
reg(R1 , R2 ) as ΠR1 ,R2 and meanwhile denote reg◦ (R1 , R2 )
as Π◦ 1 ,R2 .
R
We can use the algorithm in Fig. 4 to ﬁnd out all 2dimensional regions for any region decomposition D.
Reconsider Example 2.5. By algorithm 2, we can see that
ΠR2 ,R3 = {R2 , R3 , R4 , R5 , R7 }, ΠR1 ,R4 = {R1 , R4 , R6 ,
R8 }, ΠR7 ,R8 = {R7 , R8 , R9 }, and ΠR1 ,R9 = {R1 , R9 , R10 }
are all 2-dimensional regions of RG(D1 ).
Theorem 3.3: Let D be a region decomposition of G
such that each non-source region has at least 2 parents. If
R1 , R2 , Q1 , Q2 ∈ D such that |reg(R1 , R2 ) ∩ reg(Q1 , Q2 )| ≥
2, then either reg(R1 , R2 ) ⊆ reg(Q1 , Q2 ) or reg(Q1 , Q2 ) ⊆
reg(R1 , R2 ).
Proof: We prove this result by two steps.

In this section, we ﬁrst construct a special region graph
NRG(D∗ ), called the normal region graph of G, such that G
is linearly solvable if and only if NRG(D∗ ) is linearly solvable.
Then we characterize the linear solvability of G by NRG(D∗ ).

A. Normal Region Graph
∗

The construction process of NRG(D ) is as follows:
Step 1: Generate D1 by Algorithm 1.
By Algorithm 1, we can see that D1 satisﬁes: each nonsource region has at least 2 parents. To get NRG(D∗ ), we
need more operations on RG(D1 ). Note that by deﬁnition of
regions, a parent and a child can always be combined together
to form a new region. We can have the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1: Suppose {R1 , R2 }
⊆
D1 such that
′
reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) ̸= ∅. Let R1 = R1 ∪ reg◦ (R1 , R2 ) and
′
D′ = D1 ∪ {R1 } \ ({R1 } ∪ reg◦ (R1 , R2 )). Then D′ is a
region decomposition of G.
Step 2: Construct region decomposition D2 .
′
Let S1 and T1 denote the X1 source region and X1 sink
′
′
region respectively. If reg◦ (S1 , T1 ) ̸= ∅, let S1 = S1 ∪
◦
′
′
◦
′
reg (S1 , T1 ) and D2 = D1 ∪ {S1 } \ ({S1 } ∪ reg (S1 , T1 )).
′
Else, let D2 = D1 and S1 = S1 . By Lemma 4.1, D2 is
a region decomposition of G. Clearly, D2 satisﬁes: (1) each
non-source region has at least 2 parents; (2) S1 is the X1
source region and reg◦ (S1 , T1 ) = ∅.
Consider D1 of network G1 in Example 2.5. We have
′
′
S1 = R1 , T1 = R9 and reg◦ (S1 , T1 ) = {R10 }, then
D2 = {R1 ∪ R10 , R2 , · · · , R9 , R11 , · · · , R13 } is still a region
decomposition of G1 and S1 = R1 ∪ R10 is the X1 source
region of D2 .
Step 3: Construct the region graph NRG(D∗ ).
The region graph NRG(D∗ ) can be obtained from RG(D2 )
by the following three steps.
Step 3.1: If there is an R ∈ D2 such that R is a common
child of S1 and T1 , then delete the edge (T1 , R). Repeat this
operation until S1 and T1 have no common child.
Step 3.2: If R is a child of T1 , then delete edge (T1 , R)
and add a new edge (S1 , R) to RG(D2 ). Repeat this operation
until T1 has no child.
Step 3.3: If there is a coding region R which has more
than 2 parents, say P1 , · · · , Pk , then delete edges (Pi , R), i =
1, · · · , k − 1 and add k − 2 extra regions QR,1 , · · · , QR,k−2
and new edges (P1 , QR,1 ), (P2 , QR,1 ), (QR,i−1 , QR,i ),
(Pi+1 , QR,i )(i = 2, · · · , k − 2) and (QR,k−2 , R). Repeat this
operation until each coding region has exactly two parents.
By the above process, we get NRG(D∗ ), the normal region
graph, of G, where D∗ is the corresponded vertex set. Fig. 5
is the normal region graph of G1 in Example 2.5.
Clearly, NRG(D∗ ) is a simple, acyclic graph and satisﬁes:
(1) the sink regions have no child; (2) each coding region has
exactly 2 parents; and (3) In(T2 ) = In(T3 ).
Theorem 4.2: G is linearly solvable if and only if
NRG(D∗ ) is linearly solvable.
Proof: Suppose {dR ; R ∈ D∗ } is an LNC of NRG(D∗ ).
By the construction of NRG(D∗ ), {dR ; R ∈ D2 } is an LNC

of RG(D2 ). Let C = {de ; e ∈ E, de = dR if e ∈ R}, then C
is an LNC of G.
Conversely, suppose C is an LNC of G. According to
Algorithm 1 and as in [9], it is easy to see that there exists
an LNC {dR ; R ∈ D1 } of RG(D1 ) such that dR = dhead(R) .
For RG(D2 ), let dS1 = α1 and keep the rest encoding vectors
as in RG(D1 ). Then obviously, {dR ; R ∈ D2 } is an LNC
∑k
of RG(D2 ). In step 3.3, if dR = i=1 λi dPi (k ≥ 3), then
∑i
let dQR,i = j=1 λj dPj and keep the other encoding vectors
as in RG(D2 ); and we obtain an LNC of NRG(D∗ ), which
complete the proof.
B. Main Result
We now give a sufﬁcient and necessary condition on the linear solvability of the 2-unicast networks with c({s1 , s2 }, t2 ) =
3 by analyzing the 2-dimensional regions of NRG(D∗ ). Since
the detailed proof is complicated, we just show the sketch of
the proof here.
We suppose the considered network satisﬁes the following
two conditions:
A1: c({s1 }; {t1 }) ≥ 1, c({s2 }; {t2 }) ≥ 2, s1 → t2 and
s2 → t1 .
A2: If {e1 , e2 } is an {s1 , s2 }-{t1 } cut, then it is not an
{s2 }-{t2 } cut.
We note that A1 is natural because if c({s1 }; {t1 }) < 1 or
c({s2 }; {t2 }) < 2, then the network is unsolvable obviously.
If s2
t1 or s1
t2 , the network becomes two independent
unicast network and it is trivial to determine its solvability. A2
is also natural because for a solvable network, {e1 , e2 } is an
{s1 , s2 } − {t1 } means that α1 ∈ ⟨de1 , de2 ⟩. It is an {s2 }-{t2 }
cut means that α2 , α3 ∈ ⟨α1 , de1 , de2 ⟩. Hence, α1 , α2 , α3 ∈
⟨de1 , de2 ⟩, which derives a contradiction.
We use Si and Ti to denote the Xi source region and Xi
sink region respectively, where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We can give the
main result as follows.

Example 4.4: Let G1 be as in Example 2.5. The normal
region graph NRG(D∗ ) of G1 has been shown in Fig. 5, where
S1 = R1 ∪ R10 , S2 = R2 , S3 = R3 , T1 = R9 , T2 = R12 and
T3 = R13 . By Algorithm 2 (See Fig. 2), we can ﬁnd that
ΠS2 ,S3 = {S2 , S3 , R4 , R5 , R7 }, ΠS1 ,R4 = {S1 , R4 , R6 , R8 ,
Q}, ΠR7 ,R8 = {R7 , R8 , T1 }, and ΠR7 ,Q = {R7 , Q, R11 } are
all 2-dimensional regions of NRG(D∗ ). Rename R8 by R1 ,
R7 by R2 , R4 by R3 , and R11 by P . Then condition (1) of
Theorem 4.3 holds. So NRG(D∗ ) is not linearly solvable.
Example 4.5: Consider a region graph NRG(D∗ ) in Fig. 6.
By algorithm 2, we can ﬁnd that ΠS2 ,S3 = {S2 , S3 , R2 , R3 },
ΠS1 ,R2 = {S1 , R2 , R4 , R5 }, ΠR3 ,R4 = {R3 , R4 , R1 },
ΠR3 ,R5 = {R3 , R5 , P }, and ΠR1 ,R2 = {R1 , R2 , T1 } are all
2-dimensional regions of NRG(D∗ ). Clearly, condition (2) of
Theorem 4.3 holds. So NRG(D∗ ) is not linearly solvable.

is a LNC of NRG(D∗ ).
Suppose condition (1) holds. If ⟨dR1 ⟩ = ⟨α1 ⟩, then by
Deﬁnition 2.4, {α2 , α3 } ⊆ ⟨dS1 , dR1 , dP ⟩ = ⟨α1 , dP ⟩, a
contradiction. If ⟨dR1 ⟩ = ⟨α1 ⟩, then dR1 and α1 are lin̸
early independent. By Deﬁnition 2.4, dR1 ∈ ⟨dS1 , dR3 ⟩ =
⟨α1 , dR3 ⟩. So dR3 ∈ ⟨α1 , dR1 ⟩. Similarly, since dT1 = α1 ∈
⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩, we have dR2 ∈ ⟨α1 , dR1 ⟩. So by Deﬁnition 2.4,
{α2 , α3 } ⊆ ⟨dS1 , dR1 , dP ⟩ ⊆ ⟨dS1 , dR2 , dR3 ⟩ ⊆ ⟨α1 , dR1 ⟩, a
contradiction.
Suppose condition (2) holds. If ⟨dR1 ⟩ = ⟨dR4 ⟩, then by
Deﬁnition 2.4, {α2 , α3 } ⊆ ⟨dR1 , dR4 , dP ⟩ = ⟨dR1 , dP ⟩. So
⟨dR1 , dP ⟩ = ⟨α2 , α3 ⟩. By Deﬁnition 2.4, dT1 = α1 ∈
⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩ ⊆ ⟨dR1 , dS2 , dS3 , dP ⟩ = ⟨α2 , α3 ⟩, a contradiction.
If ⟨dR1 ⟩ ̸= ⟨dR4 ⟩, then dR1 and dR4 are linearly independent.
By Deﬁnition 2.4, dR1 ∈ ⟨dR4 , dR3 ⟩. So dR3 ∈ ⟨dR4 , dR1 ⟩.
By Deﬁnition 2.4, dS1 = dT1 = α1 ∈ ⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩ and dR4 ∈
⟨dS1 , dR2 ⟩. So dR4 ∈ ⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩. Thus, dR3 ∈ ⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩.
Also, by Deﬁnition 2.4, {α2 , α3 } ⊆ ⟨dR4 , dR1 , dP ⟩ ⊆
⟨dS1 , dR2 , dR3 ⟩ ⊆ ⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩. So {α1 , α2 , α3 } ⊆ ⟨dR1 , dR2 ⟩,
a contradiction.
The proof of the necessity is omitted.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
We investigated the network coding problem of two-unicast
network with rate (1,2). We gave a characterization of its
linearly solvability under the condition that c({s1 , s2 }, t) = 3
by developing a region decomposition method.
