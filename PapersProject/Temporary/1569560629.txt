prior distribution over the values of the entropy constructed as
a mixture of symmetric Dirichlet distributions [3]. The NSB
estimator exhibits rapid convergence to the entropy and has
good performance in terms of bias and robustness in comparison to other available estimators [1], [3], although systematic
comparisons between available estimators are lacking.
In the present correspondence, we show that further improvements can be made on the NSB estimator in terms of
estimator bias. The paper is organized as follows. We use the
Taylor power series for the logarithm function to decompose
the entropy into two terms, called the polynomial approximation term and the remainder. An accurate and unbiased
estimate for the polynomial approximation term, which is of
interest by itself, is presented. The remainder is estimated using the known Bayesian approaches. The combined estimator
has essentially better performance than the known estimators.
This claim is also conﬁrmed by simulation results.

Abstract—An algorithm for estimating the entropy, which is
based on the representation of the entropy function as the sum
of two polynomial terms, called the polynomial approximation
function and the remainder, is proposed. We construct an
accurate and unbiased estimate of the value of the polynomial
approximation function and use the known Bayesian approach
to estimate the remainder. The combined estimator essentially
reduces the bias of the constructed estimate as compared to the
known estimators. Simulation results that conﬁrm the claim are
presented.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We consider the estimation of the entropy of the probability
distributions for discrete memoryless sources when a limited
amount of observed data is available. This mathematical
problem is important for many applications. In particular,
it received a great attention in neurophysiology where the
performance of networks of neurons is evaluated by information theoretical quantities [1]. Plugging in the empirical
frequencies into the entropy function yields a direct estimate
of entropy, which is strongly negatively biased by sample
size. This negative estimator bias can translate into a strong
positive bias in mutual information. This is a serious issue for
ﬁelds such as neuroscience, where obtaining large amounts of
data is virtually impossible, because of technical limitations in
maintaining stable monitoring of neural signals for long times,
or because the brain remains in the same state only for short
periods.
Searching for an entropy estimator with minimum bias or
distortion leads to large variance and asymptotical efﬁciency
issues, and there is a general trade-off between the variance
and bias of entropy estimators [2]. A particularly promising
framework to estimate entropy is the Bayesian one [3], [4].
Wolpert and Wolf [4] developed a Bayesian estimator based
on a uniform prior distribution of probabilities. Nemenman et
al. [3], [5] pointed out that this uniform prior distribution of
probabilities corresponds to a peaked and informative prior
on the entropy with an expected value that is relatively
close to maximum entropy, leading to large errors when the
actual value of the entropy is small. Therefore, the Bayesian
Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek (NSB) estimator uses a nearly ﬂat

II. P ROBLEM OF ENTROPY ESTIMATION
Suppose that there is a discrete memoryless source which
generates one of M values (states or symbols) from the set
R = {r1 , . . . , rM } speciﬁed by the vector of probabilities
p ≡ (p1 , . . . , pM ). The (Shannon) entropy function [6] is
M
deﬁned as H(p) ≡ − m=1 pm ln(pm ) (hereafter, we assume
that 0 ln 0 = 0). The received vector of outcomes of n independent observations is deﬁned as x ≡ (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ Rn . Let
N ≡ (n1 , . . . , nM ) with the m-th component deﬁned as the
number of symbols rm in the vector x. The ‘plugin’ entropy
M
m
m
ˆ
estimator is deﬁned as Hplugin (n) = − m=1 nn ln nn
and it is well-known that it has a strict non–positive bias:
As f (pm ) ≡ −pm ln(pm ) is a concave function of pm , the
m
m
m
m
inequality E{− nn ln( nn )} ≤ − E{ nn } ln(E{ nn }) stems
from Jensen’s inequality.
The problem under consideration is to provide an estimate
ˆ
of H(p) based on the observation n, H(n), that has both
ˆ
low bias | E{H(n)} − H(p)| and low mean absolute error
ˆ
E{|H(n) − H(p)|}. We want bias and mean absolute error to
be small for all vectors of probabilities p (equivalently, for all
entropies H(p) ∈ [0, log(M )]).

The problem is formulated as ﬁnding an unbiased and
asymptotically convergent estimator of T (p) with controlled
variance. We will show that as far as estimation of T (p) is
concerned, the ‘bias problem’ can be solved completely, and
does not require the speciﬁcation of a prior distribution on the
entropy.
We ﬁrst consider the problem of deriving an unbiased estiM
mate of the sum S(p, k) = m=1 pk for all k ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

The polynomial representation T (p) is a meaningful function in itself that shares various properties with the entropy
function. (i) Like entropy, T (p) is a non-negative function.
(ii) Like the entropy function, the function T (p) is strictly
concave. (iii) Both H(p) and T (p) attain maximum values
when all probabilities are equal, and any change towards
equalization of the probabilities increases both of them. (iv)
The function T (p) is a monotonically increasing function of
M when all pm ’s are equal to each other. (v) The inequality
T (p) ≤ H(p) holds. (vi) As n → ∞, T (p) → H(p). (vii) The
function T (p) outputs larger values for the joint distribution of
multiple independent random variables than for the marginal
distributions of the individual random variables. However,
while the entropy of the joint probability distribution is the
sum of the entropies of the marginal probability distributions
of the independent random variables [6], this property does
not hold for T (p) for ﬁnite n. This is the main difference
between the entropy function and the polynomial approximation function T (p), and justiﬁes the use of the entropy
function as a measure of uncertainty about a random variable
for applications where the property of additivity is important.

These expressions are obtained using the following considerations. By Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability of
the vector p given observation of n and prior P (p) is given
as P (p|n) = P (n|p)P (p)/P (n) where P is a probability
density function on the probability distribution of the source.

V. E STIMATION OF THE REMAINDER FUNCTION R(p)
Let us address the problem of constructing a Bayesian
estimator of the remainder function R(p). We ﬁrst design
such an estimator using a symmetric Dirichlet prior over
the vectors p, which has a disadvantage that it imposes an
informative prior on H(p) [3] (see Section VI). The symmetric
Dirichlet distribution has a probability density function deﬁned
M
as Dβ (p) = Γ(β)M /Γ(M β) m=1 pβ−1 . If β → 0, then it is
m
concentrated on probability vectors that specify small values
of the entropy. If β = 1, then all p ∈ ∆M ≡ {(p1 , . . . , pM ) ∈
M
RM | ( m=1 pm ) = 1, pm ≥ 0 for all m} have a probability
density of 1, meaning that the prior on p is uniform.
We deﬁne the estimator of the entropy with Bayesian
estimation of the remainder according to a Dirichlet prior as

As discussed in the introduction, Nemenman et al. developed a nearly ﬂat prior, as a mixture of Dirichlet distributions,
on the entropy and a Bayesian (the NSB) entropy estimate
based on that [3]. Here, we will use the same prior as
developed by Nemenman et al. [3] to provide an estimator of
the remainder R(p). The uniform prior on the entropy has the
following justiﬁcation: When estimating the entropy without
any a priori knowledge about the probability distribution of
p or H(p), we can either choose to use a uniform prior on
H(p) [3], or on p [4]. A uniform prior on p imposes an
informative prior on H(p), and vice versa. While the uniform
prior on p is a sensible choice for computing the posterior
estimate P (p | n), it dominates the estimation of H(p), such
that relatively small errors in estimating p are traded against
relatively large errors in estimating H(p).

The rationale of the Dirichlet mixture is that the distribution of

the integral in eq. 23 runs effectively over d E{H(p);β} dβ =

¯
E{H(p); β}, it follows that the prior distribution D(p) of p
translates into a nearly ﬂat prior distribution of the entropy
H(p) for the interval [0, ln(M )] [3]. However, since there is
¯
some spread of H(p) around E{H(p); β}, the D(p) prior
does not translate into a completely ﬂat prior distribution of
the entropy.
Nemenman et al. [3] showed that the expression for the
Bayesian estimator of the entropy given this prior reduces to
the one-dimensional integral

Hβ (n) =

vectors of p (minimax principle). However, the reduction in
bias was accompanied by a balanced increase in variance such
that the mean absolute errors of the NSB and Υβ (n) estimator
¯
were close to each other.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
We have proposed a new algorithm for estimating the
entropy, which is based on the representation of the entropy
function as the sum of two polynomial terms, called the
polynomial approximation function and the remainder. We
have shown that an accurate and unbiased estimate of the
value of the polynomial approximation function exists that
does not depend on the choice of any particular prior on the
probability distribution of the source. In addition, we have used
the known Bayesian approach with a nearly ﬂat prior on the
entropy [3] to estimate the remainder. Our simulations show
that the combined estimator essentially reduces the bias of the
constructed estimate as compared to the known estimators.
An advantage of our estimator relative to the NSB estimator
is that part of the entropy function is estimated without the
dependence on any particular prior, since the nearly uniform
prior developed by [3] as a mixture of Dirichlet distributions
is not the only possible uniform prior on the entropy, and is
uniform only by approximation.

VII. C OMPARISON OF BIAS AND ERROR OF ENTROPY
ESTIMATORS

We performed an exact (by computing probability of all n)
evaluation of the bias and mean absolute error of: (i) The
ˆ
plugin estimator Hplugin (n). (ii) The classic Miller-Madow
ˆ¯
estimator [7] (eq. 10) (iii) The Bayesian Hβ (n) estimator
ˆ
(eq. 24) [3]. (iv) Our newly developed polynomial T (n) (eq.
8) estimator and our polynomial-Bayesian estimator Υβ (n)
¯
(eq. 19). For a given number of symbols M ∈ {16, 225}, we
varied the concentration parameter β of a symmetric Dirichlet
distribution such that we covered the expected entropies in the
interval [1/10000, ln(M ) − 1/1000] with a step-size of 1/10.
Note that the number of trials in neuroscience experiments
is typically small and often does not exceed tens of trials per
stimulus. For a particular symmetric Dirichlet distribution with
concentration parameter β and expected entropy E{H(p); β}
(eq. 22), we then drew a vector of probabilities p from that
Dirichlet distribution. The entropy of the drawn vector of probabilities p, H(p), does not exactly coincide with E{H(p); β},
but lies relatively close to it, since the distribution of H(p) is
highly peaked if p is Dirichlet-distributed [3].
Our polynomial-Bayesian Υβ (n) estimator, exhibited a sig¯
niﬁcant reduction in bias in comparison to the other entropy
estimators, having the lowest overall bias of all estimators,
for all number of symbols M tested (Figure 1) (M = 5 and
81 gave similar results, data not presented). Furthermore, it
had the smallest bias across the interval [0, ln(M )] for all
estimators tested (Figure 2). The average reduction in bias
in comparison to the NSB estimator was particularly strong
when M was relatively small. This is a particularly useful
property for applications where many symbols have pm = 0,
and M is over-estimated. Similarly, the reduction in bias of the
Υβ (n) estimator relative to the NSB estimator was particularly
¯
pronounced when the entropy was close to 0, but was also
present when the entropy was close to ln(M ). This shows
that, for this particular setting, the Υβ (n) estimator is, in
¯
terms of bias, more robust than the NSB estimator, since
it exhibited the smallest maximum bias across probability
