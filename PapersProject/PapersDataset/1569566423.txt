Abstract—Write-once memory (WOM) is a binary storage write
medium in which each memory cell is initially in state 0 and
can be irreversibly programmed to state 1. This paper studies
the problem of writing multiple messages into a WOM. Instead
of writing a new message (and obliterating old ones) as in the 2nd
traditional setup, the user wishes to retain access to some of the write
previously written messages. The capacity region is studied and
code constructions are proposed for three canonical cases.

I. I NTRODUCTION AND M AIN R ESULTS
As part of the tremendous increase in coding research for
the ubiquitous ﬂash memories, a considerable attention has
been given to rewriting codes. The motivation comes from the
special physical properties of the ﬂash memory ﬂoating-gate
cells, the most conspicuous of which is the asymmetric programming behavior of the cells [1]. The memory cells can
only increase their level by the injection of electrons to each
cell. However, in order to decrease the level of even a single cell, its entire containing block (∼ 106 cells) has to be
erased. This undesired property not only reduces the writing
speed but also signiﬁcantly affects the lifetime of ﬂash memories, which is often speciﬁed in terms of a maximum number
of block erasures [1]. As this number can be as low as a few
hundreds or thousands, reducing the number of block erasures
becomes critical in improving the lifetime of ﬂash memories.
The idea of rewriting codes dates back to the pioneering work [10] by Rivest and Shamir on write-once memory
(WOM) in 1982. The motivation came from storage media
such as punch cards and ablative optical disks. These media are modeled as a collection of write-once binary cells,
where each cell is initially in state 0 and can be irreversibly
programmed to state 1. Figure 1 shows a typical model for
rewriting t times on a binary WOM.
An [n, t; 2nR , . . . , 2nR ] WOM code consists of
nR
], . . . , [1 : 2nR ],
• t message sets [1 : 2
• t encoders, where encoder i ∈ [1 : t] for the i-th write
assigns a codeword xi = Ei (mi , yi−1 ) ∈ {0, 1}n (y0 =
∅) to each message mi ∈ [1 : 2nR ] and the cell levels
yi−1 from the previous write, and
• t decoders, where decoder i ∈ [1 : t] assigns an estimate
mi = Di (yi ) or an error e to the cell levels yi from the
ˆ
i-th write.
The notation [i : j] denotes the set {k ∈ Z : i k j}.
The average probability of error of the WOM code is deﬁned

as Pe(n) = P{(M1 , . . . , Mt ) = (M1 , . . . , Mt)}. A rate tuple
(R1 , . . . , Rt ) is said to be achievable for the WOM if there exists a sequence of [n, t; 2nR , . . . , 2nR ] WOM codes such that

sum-capacity Csum (t) of WOM is the maximum achievable
sum-rate t Rj . A sequence of WOM codes is said to be

in the limit.
The capacity region as well as the sum-capacity for the
WOM model is well studied in the literature [3], [5]; for example, it is known that the t-write sum-capacity is Csum (t) =
log2 (t + 1) and the capacity region is

Furthermore, many code constructions have been found
(e.g., [8], [12], [13]), the sum-rates of which are close to the
sum-capacity.
Following the work by Rivest and Shamir on the binary
WOM, many papers on WOM codes appeared during the
1980s and 1990s, (e.g., [2], [3], [5], [11]) as well as in the
past few years (e.g., [4], [6], [8], [9], [12]). Among all of
the existing models for rewriting on ﬂash memories, one assumes that a new message is stored in the memory on each
write, effectively overwriting previously written messages.
This can be a drawback in some applications, however, if
the user wishes to retain access to one or more previously
written messages. For example, suppose that a police station
keeps trafﬁc surveillance videos for up to a certain amount of
time, say 30 days. This requires that the most current video
as well as the videos from the previous 29 days be retrievable
at any time. If the entire set of 30 daily videos are treated as
a completely new message to be written on top of the existing content of the memory cells, the writing efﬁciency will
be low, because the same message is being written multiple
times via different codewords.
This motivates the model of rewriting ﬂash memories with
retained messages. This model is related to the work on buffer

codes and trajectory codes [6], [7], which are capable of remembering the most recent values stored in the memories. To
make the problem simple, in this paper we consider rewriting
on a binary WOM, where after each write the current message
and some of the previously written messages need to be retrievable. We aim to characterize the optimal rate tradeoff and
ﬁnd code constructions focusing on three concrete problems
motivated by different scenarios in real storage systems.
In Section II, we formulate the problem of retaining two
days of video surveillance as follows.

than this? In Section III, we construct a code by enlarging the
number of blocks, and we show that it can strictly outperform
the above code. Moreover, it is shown to be asymptotically
optimal in t. A simple outer bound on the capacity region and
an upper bound on the sum-capacity are also presented.
Now we introduce the last problem. Suppose the surveillance videos are layered as high-ﬁdelity and low-ﬁdelity ones,
e.g., encoded by the H.264 standard. On each day, all lowﬁdelity videos from previous days and the high-ﬁdelity video
from the current day should be stored. This motivates the following.

III. A RBITRARY T WO -S TEP WOM
In this section we study the arbitrary two-step WOM deﬁned in Problem 2. Note that if a WOM code C is a t-write
arbitrary two-step WOM code, then we can construct from
it a t-write consecutive two-step WOM code. Therefore, the
2
sum-capacity Csum (t) of the arbitrary two-step WOM is upper
t

bounded as Csum (t) Csum (t) = log2 ( 2 + 1).
Now we give a construction that strictly outperforms the
1
construction in the introduction and achieves 2/3 of Csum (t)
of the consecutive two-step WOM, while keeping track of arbitrary messages as required. Partition the set of all cells into
three blocks as illustrated in Table II. In the ﬁrst two blocks,
we write in the exactly same manner as for the consecutive
two-step WOM. The third block is updated with Ms(i) every
other write to help retrieve the desired message of the arbitrary demand. This can be improved by further enlarging the
number of blocks as given in Construction 2.

The above outer and inner bounds coincide at the sumrate and establish the sum-capacity of the consecutive two-step
WOM for every t.

Due to space limitations, we skip the proofs. In the following, we give a code construction1 for even t, which is sum-rate
optimal. It also serves as part of the proof for Proposition 2.
Partition the set of all cells into two blocks and write odd messages to one block on odd writes and even messages to the
other block on even writes, as shown in Table I. Thus, each
block of cells can reliably store t/2 messages using a traditional (t/2)-write WOM code and decoder i can recover both
messages (Mi−1 , Mi ) stored in the two blocks.

Similarly, the capacity region of the three-write WOM is
given by {(R1 , R2 , R3 )|R1 h(p2 ), R2 p2 h(p3 ), R3
p2 p3 , for some p2 , p3 ∈ [1/2, 1]}. Thus, it can be shown that
the values of p2 , p3 ∈ [1/2, 1] that give the minimum code
length for n3 (λ) satisfy
h(p2 )/(p2 h(p3 )) = 1 − λ,
(2)
h(p3 )/p3 = 1/2.
(3)
The value of p3 is independent of λ and is given by p3 =
0.9055, and p2 (λ) is the solution to equation (2). Hence, n3 (λ)
satisﬁes n3 (λ) = 2k/((p2(λ)p3 ).
We are now left to solve the minimization problem
