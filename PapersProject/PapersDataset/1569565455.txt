channel which generalizes Cover-Leung’s scheme (intended
for MACs) [7], and achieves rates within 1 bit/s/Hz per transmitter of the cut-set outer bound for all channel parameters.
We further extend our results for the case of M -transmitters
and approximate the feedback capacity within log {2(M − 1)}
bits/s/Hz per transmitter. We ﬁnd that feedback can provide
multiplicative gain in the high-SNR regime, and that feedback
is useful not only for mitigating interference [5], but also for
providing qualitatively-similar gains for channels with a manyto-many structure. In particular, we ﬁnd that the feedback capacity region strictly enlarges the intersection of the feedback
capacity regions of K individual MACs. This is in contrast to
the non-feedback case where the capacity region is simply the
intersection of K individual MAC capacity regions.
To complement our results on approximate feedback capacity, we establish the exact feedback capacity region of
the Avestimehr-Diggavi-Tse (ADT) deterministic model. We
also ﬁnd that feedback increases the achievable rates for
function computation. Speciﬁcally using a two-source tworeceiver example where each receiver wants to reconstruct
a modulo-2 sum of two independent Bernoulli sources, we
demonstrate that feedback can increase the non-feedback computing capacity.
Related Work: Feedback strategies for MACs were studied
previously in [3], [4], [7]–[10]. For the two-user case, Cover
and Leung [7] developed an achievable scheme that employs
block Markov encoding and a decode-and-forward scheme.
Willems [8] proved the optimality of this scheme for a class
of deterministic channels. Ozarow [3] established the exact
feedback capacity region using a different approach based on
Schalkwijk-Kailath’s scheme [11]. Kramer developed more
generic techniques of the approach to handle an arbitrary
number of transmitters [4].
Other related work includes the two-user compound MAC
with conferencing encoders [12], [13] or decoders [14]. In
addition, Lim-Kim-El Gamal-Chung recently developed an
achievable scheme for discrete memoryless networks [15], and
demonstrated the approximate optimality of their scheme for
multi-source Gaussian multicast networks. Our feedback channel with unfolding can be cast into a multi-source Gaussian
multicast network. However, we exploit the structure of our
feedback channel to induce correlation between transmitters
which leads to a tighter result.

Abstract—We characterize the capacity region to within
log {2(M − 1)} bits/s/Hz for the M -transmitter K-receiver Gaussian multicast channel with feedback where each receiver wishes
to decode every message from the M transmitters. Extending
Cover-Leung’s achievable scheme intended for (M, K) = (2, 1),
we show that this generalized scheme achieves the cutset-based
outer bound within log {2(M − 1)} bits per transmitter for all
channel parameters. In contrast to the capacity in the nonfeedback case, the feedback capacity improves upon the naive
intersection of the feedback capacities of K individual multiple
access channels. We ﬁnd that feedback provides unbounded
multiplicative gain at high signal-to-noise ratios as was shown in
the Gaussian interference channel. To complement the results, we
establish the exact feedback capacity of the Avestimehr-DiggaviTse deterministic model, from which we make the observation
that feedback can also be beneﬁcial for function computation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A traditional viewpoint on feedback capacity has been
pessimistic over the past few decades. This is mainly due to
Shannon’s original result on feedback capacity which shows
that feedback provides no increase in capacity for discrete
memoryless point-to-point channels [1]. For multiple-access
channels (MACs), feedback can increase the capacity [2];
however, the increase in capacity for Gaussian MACs is
bounded by at most 1 bit for all channel parameters [3].
In contrast to these results, recent research shows that
feedback provides more signiﬁcant gain for communication
over interference channels [4]–[6]. Interestingly, the feedback
gain can be unbounded for certain channel parameters. One
distinction of interference channels with respect to MACs is
that each receiver decodes its desired message in the presence
of undesired interfering signals. A natural question to ask is
whether feedback gain depends crucially on the presence of
interference.
In this paper, we make progress towards addressing this
question. To isolate the interference issue, we start with
a Gaussian MAC with two transmitters and feedback. We
then modify the channel by adding additional receivers with
identical message demands and feedback links from those
receivers to the two transmitters. We call the new channel the
two-transmitter, K-receiver Gaussian multicast channel with
feedback. Note that this channel does not pose any interference while still maintaining the many-to-many structure of
interference channels. We present a coding scheme for this

We focus on the Gaussian multicast channel with M = 2
transmitters and K receivers ﬁrst. Section IV-C includes our
results for M > 2. As shown in Fig. 1, each receiver decodes
all of the messages and is able to feed its received signal back
to both transmitters. Without loss of generality, we normalize
the transmit powers as P1 = P2 = 1 and channel noise powers
as Zk ∼ CN (0, 1) for all k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Hence, the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver captures the effect of the
channel gains: SNRmk
|gmk |2 ; gmk ∈ C is the complexvalued channel gain from transmitter m to receiver k.
Each transmitter m ∈ {1, 2} encodes an independent and
uniformly distributed message Wm ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2N Rm }. The
encoded signal Xmi of transmitter m at time i is a function of its own message and past feedback signals: Xmi =
i−1
fmi Wm , Y1i−1 , · · · , YK . We deﬁne Yki−1
{Ykt }i−1
t=1
where Yki is the received signal at receiver k at time i. A rate
pair (R1 , R2 ) is said to be achievable if there exists a family
of codebooks and corresponding encoding/decoding functions
such that the average decoding error probabilities go to zero
as the code length N tends to inﬁnity. The capacity region C
is the closure of the set of the achievable rate pairs.

R ⊆ C ⊆ R ⊕ ([0, 1] × [0, 1]) .
Proof: The proof is immediate. Let δ1 = (2) − (1).
Similarly we deﬁne δ2 and δ12 . Straightforward computation
then gives δ1 ≤ log(1 + ρ) ≤ 1. Similarly, we get δ2 ≤ 1 and
δ12 = 0. This completes the proof.
Remark 2: Fig. 2 shows a numerical result of the innerand-upper bound gap for the symmetric capacity, denoted
by Csym = sup {R : (R, R) ∈ C}. For illustrative purpose,
.
we consider a two-receiver symmetric channel setting where
SNR1 := SNR11 = SNR22 and SNR2 := SNR12 = SNR21 .
While the worst-case gap is 1 bit due to the coarse analysis in
Corollary 1, the actual gap is upper-bounded by approximately
0.08 over a wide range of channel parameters. This suggests
that a reﬁned analysis could lead to an even smaller gap. For
instance, in the high-SNR regime, we obtain the asymptotic
symmetric capacity as follows.

Feedback Gain: From Theorems 1 and 2, we can see that
feedback can provide a signiﬁcant capacity increase as was
shown in the Gaussian interference channel [5]. To see this
clearly, let us consider the two-receiver symmetric channel
setting as above. Fig. 3 plots the high-SNR-regime symmetric
capacity normalized by the MAC symmetric capacity for Rx

use α := max{log SNR1 ,log SNR2 } for x-axis to indicate a signal
strength difference between SNR1 and SNR2 . Note that the

individual MAC capacities:

Note that the gap between Csym and C1,sym can be arbitrarily
large when SNR1 and SNR2 are far apart, i.e., α ≤ 1 . On the
2
other hand, the symmetric feedback capacity is asymptotically
the same as if there were only one receiver. As a result,
1
feedback provides multiplicative gain for the regime of α ≤ 2 .
In Section IV-A, we will provide an intuition behind this gain
while describing an achievable scheme.

A. Achievability: Proof of Theorem 1
Motivating Example (Fig. 4): To develop an achievable
scheme for the Gaussian channel, we utilize the ADT deterministic model [16] illustrated in Fig. 5 as an intermediate
yet insightful model. The ADT multicast channel with M
transmitters and K receivers is characterized by M K values:
nmk , 1 ≤ m ≤ M, 1 ≤ k ≤ K where nmk indicates the
number of signal bit levels from transmitter m to receiver k.

Fig. 4. Motivating example: An achievable scheme for a (1.5, 1.5) rate-pair.

These values correspond to the channel gains of the Gaussian
channel in dB scale: nmk = log SNRmk . See [16] for
explicit details.
We ﬁrst explain an achievable scheme for a particular ADT
model example, illustrated in Fig. 4. Speciﬁcally, we show
how to achieve a (1.5, 1.5) rate-pair with feedback. As will
be seen in Theorem 4, the feedback capacity region is given
by R1 + R2 ≤ 3. Extrapolating from this example, we later
make observations leading to a generic achievable scheme.
In the nonfeedback case, transmitter 1 can send only one bit
a1 through the top level, since the mincut between transmitter
1 and receiver 2 is limited by 1. Similarly transmitter 2 can
send only one bit, say b1 . However, feedback provides more
options to route by creating additional paths, e.g., [T x1 →
Rx1 → feedback → T x2 → Rx2]. This additional path
enables an increase over the nonfeedback rate. Transmitter
1 squeezes one more bit A1 in the second level. Similarly
transmitter 2 squeezes B1 in its own second level. Receiver
1 then gets A1 , while receiver 2 does not. Similarly B1 is
received only at receiver 2. We will show that these A1 and
B1 can also be delivered to the other receivers with the help
of feedback. At the beginning of time 2, transmitter 1 can
. decode B1 with feedback. Similarly transmitter 2 can decode
A1 . In time 2, transmitters 1 and 2 start with sending their own
fresh information a2 and b2 on the top levels respectively. Now
the idea is that transmitter 1 forwards the fed back B1 using
the second level. Note that this transmission allows receiver
1 to obtain B1 without causing any harm to the transmission
of (a2 , b2 ). Similarly transmitter 2 can deliver A1 to receiver
2. Therefore, during the two time slots, transmitters 1 and 2
can deliver (a1 , a2 , A1 ) and (b1 , b2 , B1 ) respectively to both
receivers, thus achieving (1.5, 1.5).
Remark 3: The gain comes from the fact that feedback
creates alternative paths to provide routing gain. In fact, this
gain was already observed by [5] in the context of twouser strong interference channels where n12 ≥ n11 and
n21 ≥ n22 in the ADT model. However in [5], this routing
gain does not appear in the weak interference regime such as
(n12 = 1 < n11 = 3, n21 = 1 < n22 = 3). On the other hand,
in our multicast channel, we can see this routing gain even
when cross links are weaker than direct links.

the covariance between X1 and X2 is E[X1 X2 ] = ρ. Starting
with Fano’s inequality,

This example leads us to make two observations. First,
feedback enables each transmitter to decode the other transmitter’s information and then forwards this in the next time slot.
Second, the transmitted signals in time 2 can be correlated
with the previously-sent information. This motivates us to
employ the decoding-and-forward and block Markov encoding
schemes. In fact, an achievable scheme combining these two
ideas was developed by Cover-Leung [7] in the context of
the two-user discrete memoryless MAC with feedback. In this
paper, we generalize this scheme to the multiple-receiver case,
thereby obtaining an approximate capacity region within a
provably small gap. As for a decoding operation, we employ
backward decoding [17].
Here is the outline of achievability. We employ block
Markov encoding with a total size B of blocks. In block 1,
each transmitter sends its own information. In block 2, with
feedback, each transmitter decodes the other user’s information
(sent in block 1). The two previously-sent messages are
then available at each transmitter. Conditioning on these two
messages, each transmitter generates its own fresh message
and then sends a corresponding codeword. Each transmitter
repeats this procedure until block B − 1. In the last block
B, to facilitate backward decoding, each transmitter sends a
predetermined message. Each receiver waits until a total of
B blocks have been received and then performs backward
decoding.
The achievable scheme outlined above is broadly applicable
and not limited to the Gaussian channel. We characterize an
achievable rate region for discrete mememoryless multicast
channels in Lemma 1 and then choose an appropriate joint
distribution to obtain the desired result. The generic coding
scheme is also applicable to the ADT deterministic model and
details will be presented in Section V.
Lemma 1: The feedback capacity region of the twotransmitter K-receiver discrete memoryless multicast channel
includes the set of (R1 , R2 ) such that
R1 ≤ I(X1 ; Y1 , · · · , YK |X2 , U )

C. Generalization to M -transmitter Case
We extend our results for M > 2 transmitters. For M > 2,
a multitude of auxiliary random variables can be incorporated
to induce correlation between many transmitter pairs. For
simplicity, however, we consider a natural extension of the
two-transmitter case which includes only one auxiliary random
variable. The only distinction is that with feedback, each transmitter decodes all of the messages of the other transmitters,
and generates its new messages and a corresponding codeword,
conditioned on all of these decoded messages. Details on the
inner bound and the cut-set outer bounds are given in [18].
See Theorems 3 and 4 in [18]. Here we only provide a gap
result derived from the inner and outer bounds.
Theorem 3 (Constant Gap): The gap between the inner
¯
bound RM and outer bound CM in [18] is upper-bounded
by ∆ := log {2(M − 1)} bits/s/Hz/transmitter:

discrete random variable which takes on values in the set U
where |U| ≤ min {|X1 ||X2 |, |Y1 |, · · · , |YK |} + 2.
Proof: Due to space limitation, we include a formal proof
in the full version of this paper [18].
We now choose the following Gaussian input distribution to
complete the proof: ∀m = 1, 2,

where Xm = U + Xm and (U, X1 , X2 ) are independent.
Straightforward computation then gives the achievable rate
region. This completes the proof.

The ADT model was developed as a method of analysis
to approximate the feedback capacity region of the Gaussian
multicast channel. In this section, we ﬁnd the exact feedback
capacity region of the deterministic channel.

Proof: The achievability proof is immediate due to
Lemma 2 in [18]. For the converse proof, see Appendix C
in [18].
VI. F UNCTION C OMPUTATION
As a by-product of Theorem 4, we can ﬁnd an interesting
role of feedback for other communication scenarios such as
computation in networks. To see this, consider an (M, K) =
(2, 2) ADT multicast channel with feedback and parameters
n11 = n22 = 3 and n12 = n21 = 1 (see Fig. 4). Suppose
that both receivers wish to compute the same function of
modulo-2 sums of two independent Bernoulli sources (S1 , S2 )
generated at the two transmitters. The computing rate for
decoding S1 ⊕ S2 at all receivers is denoted Rcomp . Without
feedback, the following cut-set based argument provides a
bound on Rcomp : N (Rcomp − N ) ≤ I(S1 ⊕S2 ; Y1N ) ≤ I(S1 ⊕
N
N
S2 ; Y1N , S1 ) = I(S1 ⊕S2 ; Y1N |S1 , X1 ) ≤ H(Y1N |S1 , X1 ) ≤
N
i=1 H(Y1i |X1i ), where the equality is due to the fact that
S1 ⊕ S2 is independent of S1 . For the particular ADT example
in Fig. 4, H(Y1 |X1 ) ≤ 1 and H(Y2 |X2 ) ≤ 1, from which
Rcomp ≤ 1. On the other hand, the example in Fig. 4 shows the
3
FB
achievability of ( 3 , 2 ), thus yielding Rcomp ≥ 3 . Therefore,
2

feedback can increase rates for computation. Our future work
is to extend this example to larger classes of networks.
VII. C ONCLUSION
We established the feedback capacity region of the Gaussian
multicast channel with M transmitters and K receivers to
within log {2(M − 1)} bits/s/Hz per transmitter of the cutset
bound universally over all channel parameters. We characterized the exact feedback capacity region of the ADT model,
and observed a feedback gain for function computation. Our
future work is along the following directions: (1) Improving
