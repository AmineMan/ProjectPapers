lattice [7, 8]. Another scheme of approximate lattice precoding
was proposed in [9] (we will show that it is actually equivalent
to LR-aided ZF in [8]), which was shown to achieve the full
diversity order.
In contrast to the complexity analysis of sphere decoding
[10], the complexity of sphere precoding is not available
in literature. Moreover, the signal-to-noise (SNR) gap between sphere precoding and LR-aided precoding has not been
analyzed, although it has been done for decoding [11]. In
this paper, we investigate these aspects of lattice precoding
algorithms. We view the precoding problem as a variant of
the CVP known as η-CVP. This view enables us to derive
the proximity factors for lattice precoding, which measure
the worst-case loss in power efﬁciency of LR-aided precoding
schemes.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents
the model of MIMO broadcast using lattice precoding, and
investigates its complexity. In Section III the analysis of the
proximity factors is given. Section V is a discussion.

Abstract—Lattice precoding is an effective strategy for multiantenna broadcast. In this paper, we show that approximate
lattice precoding in multiantenna broadcast is a variant of the
closest vector problem (CVP) known as η-CVP. The proximity
factors of lattice reduction-aided precoding are deﬁned, and
their bounds are derived, which measure the worst-case loss in
power efﬁciency compared to sphere precoding. Unlike decoding
applications, this analysis does not suffer from the boundary
effect of a ﬁnite constellation, since the underlying lattice in
multiantenna broadcast is indeed inﬁnite.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Broadcast is referred to as the application where a single
transmitter sends different messages to many users simultaneously. It may arise, for example, in the downlink of a
multiuser communication system where the base station wants
to communicate with the users in the area of coverage. The
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology offers a new
opportunity for developing efﬁcient broadcast strategies.
The capacity of a MIMO broadcast channel has been
determined in [1], where it was shown that the so-called dirtypaper coding is instrumental to achieving the capacity. Multiple antennas allow to pre-cancel the interuser interference,
which is known at the transmitter in the broadcast application.
The lattice method represents a major approach to cancelling
known interference [2], and speciﬁcally, to precoding for
MIMO broadcast. However, dirty-paper coding suffers from
high complexity.
Hochwald et al. [3] formulated precoding as a decoding
problem at the transmitter. Their technique, termed “vector
perturbation”, corresponds to solving the closest lattice vector
problem (CVP). It requires the use of the sphere precoder
[4], whose average complexity grows quickly with the system
size. Earlier, the idea of precoding via an algorithmic search
over modulo equivalent points was proposed by Fischer et al.
for the intersymbyol interference channel [5]. More recently,
reference [6] considered some practical issues in the implementation of vector perturbation.
To reduce the complexity, lattice reduction (LR) can be
used, i.e., an approximate solution is found by zero-forcing
(ZF) or successive interference cancelation (SIC) on a reduced

II. L ATTICE P RECODING FOR MIMO B ROADCAST
Consider a MIMO broadcast system including one transmitter, equipped with n antennas, and n receivers, each equipped
with a single antenna [3]. For convenience, we use the realvalued signal model
y = Hs + n,

(1)

where y is the received signal vector at the users, H ∈ Rn×n
is a full-rank channel matrix, s is the transmitted signal, and
n is the noise vector. The entry hi,j of H indicates the
channel coefﬁcient between transmit antenna i and user j. s
T
is derived from the data vector x = [x1 , ..., xn ] . We assume
n
that x ∈ [−A/2, A/2] is taken from the intersection of a
ﬁnite hypercube and an integer lattice. The entries of n are
i.i.d. Gaussian with variance σ 2 each.

Note that s ∈ V(L(AB)) (the Voronoi region). The receivers
apply the modulo function each, obtaining

A. Lattice Preliminaries
An n-dimensional lattice in the m-dimensional Euclidean
space Rm (n ≤ m) is the set of integer linear combinations
of n independent vectors b1 , . . . , bn ∈ Rm :
{ n
}
∑
L (B) =
xi bi |xi ∈ Z, i = 1, . . . n .

y

=x+n

The matrix B = [b1 · · · bn ] is a basis of the lattice L(B). In
matrix form, L(B) = {Bx : x ∈ Zn }. For any point y ∈Rm
and any lattice L (B), the distance of y to the lattice is
dist(y, B) = minx∈Zn ∥y − Bx∥. A shortest vector of a
lattice L (B) is a non-zero vector in L (B) with the smallest
Euclidean norm. The length of the shortest vector, often
referred to as the minimum distance, of L (B) is denoted by
λ1 .
A lattice has inﬁnitely many bases. In general, every matrix
B = BU is also a basis, where U is an unimodular matrix,
i.e., det(U) = ±1 and all elements of U are integers. The aim
of lattice reduction is to ﬁnd a good basis for a given lattice. In
many applications, it is advantageous to have the basis vectors
as short as possible. The celebrated LLL algorithm is the ﬁrst
polynomial (average) time algorithm which ﬁnds a vector not
much longer than the shortest nonzero vector.
ˆ
ˆ
Let b1 ,...,bn be the Gram-Schmidt vectors corresponding to
ˆ
a basis b1 ,...,bn , where bi is the projection of bi orthogonal to
the vector space generated by b1 ,...,bi−1 . These are the vectors
found by the Gram-Schmidt algorithm for orthogonalization.
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) is closely related to
QR decomposition B = QR. More precisely, one has the
ˆ
relations µj,i = ri,j /ri,i and bi = ri,i · qi , where qi is the ith
column of Q.
A basis B is LLL reduced if

Decoding gets easier for weaker noise, while noise has
no impacts on the hardness of lattice precoding.
The constellation in decoding is often ﬁnite, while the
lattice in precoding is inﬁnite. Thus, the boundary errors
in decoding will not an issue in precoding.
The received signal in decoding has a Gaussian distribution centered at a lattice point, while the input to precoding is roughly uniformly distributed on a fundamental
parallelepiped.

For these reasons, sphere precoding incurs more computational complexity than sphere decoding at the same dimension
n. Fincke and Pohst [12] proposed an algorithm to enumerate
the lattice points in a sphere, running on an LLL-reduced
lattice, but their complexity estimate was loose. Kannan’s
algorithm [13] for HKZ reduction can be used to preprocess
the lattice, giving a CVP algorithm with nn+o(n) complexity.
Hanrot and Stehl´ ’ improved the CVP complexity analysis to
e
nn/2+o(n) [14].
On the other hand, Jald´ n and Ottersten [10] showed that
e
the average complexity of sphere decoding is exponential
with the dimension for any ﬁxed SNR; the constant within
the exponent, though, does decrease with SNR, meaning
lower complexity at higher SNR. However, the encouraging
results for lattice decoding do not extend to precoding. Noise,
which is crucial to the decreasing complexity of sphere
decoding, does not even arise in lattice precoding. Since
the input is largely uniformly distributed in the fundamental
parallelepiped, the worst-case bound is a sensible measure
of complexity. Moreover, the paper [10] assumed a ﬁnite
constellation, rendering the analysis inapplicable to an inﬁnite
lattice, which is nonetheless the case for precoding problems.
To conclude, the worst-cast complexity of sphere precoding
is super-exponential.

Namely, the data arrive at individual users free of interuser
interference; the only effect is noise. To solve the CVP (5), the
sphere precoding algorithm originally proposed for decoding
purposes was used.
It is worth pointing out several distinctions between the
CVP’s in decoding and precoding:

for 1 < i ≤ n, where 1/4 < δ ≤ 1 is a factor selected to
achieve a good quality-complexity tradeoff.
We now deﬁne a variant of the CVP.

1) SIC Precoding: To obtain a fast precoder, Windpassinger
et al. [8] approximated the CVP by using lattice reduction,
i.e., the closest vector is replaced with Babai’s approximations
[7]. Let B designate the reduced basis, i.e., B = BU, where
U is a unimodular matrix. Performing the QR decomposition
B = QR, where Q has orthogonal columns and R is an upper
triangular matrix with nonnegative diagonal elements.

for SIC. Therefore, the objective of lattice reduction in this

application is to minimize the Frobenious norm of B or B.
However, it is computationally hard to exactly accomplish this
objective. Thus, the LLL algorithm is often used.

III. P ROXIMITY FACTORS

The transmitted signal is given by
s = Bx − ABˆ
l.

We want to understand the performance of approximate
lattice precoding. To do this, we compare the transmission
powers with that of sphere encoding, under the condition that
they have the same error performance, namely, (6) and (9) hold
at the receivers. This is a standard approach to calculating the
“coding gain”1 .
The transmission power of sphere precoding is given by

At the receivers, the modulo operation is applied, yielding

by ZF as follows
⌈

ˆ B−1 u = U x .

where V denotes the Voronoi region of L(B), and σ 2 (V) is
the second moment of V. Then, the SNR gap is asymptotically
given by

Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult to compute ρ, and we resort
to the proximity factors of LLL reduction-aided precoding,
which measure the worst-case loss in power efﬁciency relative
to sphere precoding. More formally, we deﬁne the proximity
factor as


 sup ∥s∥ZF , for ZF;
∥s∥2
SP
FP

 sup ∥s∥SIC , for SIC.

(10)

The second line of (10) represents the transmission scheme
in [8], while the third line corresponds to the transmission
scheme in [9]. Therefore, the schemes proposed in [8, 9] are
equivalent. To the best of our knowledge, this equivalence is
not known in literature. At the receivers, the modulo operation
is applied, yielding the same as (9).

SP

Obviously, ρ ≤ FP . This viewpoint implies that the precoding
problem is η-CVP:

D. Reduction Criteria
To summarize, the purpose of approximate lattice precoding
is to ﬁnd a sub-optimal solution ˆ that can reduce the norm
l
∥s∥. Withe lattice reduction, the transmitted vector s falls
into the fundamental parallelepiped (for ZF) or the rectangle
spanned by the Gram-Schmidt vectors of the reduced basis
AB (for SIC). In both cases, the transmission power is
proportional to the second moment over the respective regions.
Let V = | det B| be the fundamental volume of L(B), and P
be its fundamental parallelepiped. Let ∥B∥2 be the Frobenius
ˆ
norm of B, and B be the Gram-Schmidt matrix for B.
Using a uniform-distribution approximation, the transmission
powers associated with the approximate lattice precoders are
respectively given by

and consequently, FP ≤ η 2 . Babai derived the value of η [7]
in the case of δ = 3/4. In what follows, we will derive the
bounds in the general case. Let α = 1/(δ − 1/4).

IV. D ISCUSSION
Our main contribution in this paper was to view the LRaided precoding problem as η-CVP, compared to the viewpoint
of bounded distance decoding for LR-aided decoding [11].
This viewpoint allowed us to derive the proximity factors,
which measure the worst-cased bound for approximate lattice
precoding. Since the underlying lattice is inﬁnite, this analysis
is rigorous, and it follows that LR-aided precoding also
achieves full diversity. The derived bounds may not be tight,
but nonetheless give more insights. Improving the bounds is
the future work.
