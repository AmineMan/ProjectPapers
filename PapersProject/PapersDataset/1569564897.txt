for studying these code based on matrix transformation via
Fourier transforms [7], [9]. By matrix transformation, ranks
of certain classes of algebraic QC-LDPC codes [7], [6] are
given, but some constraints may have to be applied.
In this paper, we follow the Fourier transform approach
presented in [7] to expand the analysis and construction of
all QC-LDPC codes. Based on the properties of conjugacy
classes and Hadamard products of matrices, general analysis
includes the rank and row-redundancy of an array of circulants
whose null space gives a QC-LDPC code. Tight and general
upper and lower bounds on the rank and row-redundancy
of an array of circulants are derived. For some known QCLDPC codes, the equalities of these bounds hold. Thanks to
the general lower bound on row-redundancy, it is possible
for us to construct redundant rows in code design, which
make it possible to further improve the performance of QCLDPC codes from row-redundancy way. Moreover, a new
construction of algebraic QC-LDPC codes, which is based on
random partitions of ﬁnite ﬁelds, are also given. These codes
not only have ﬂexible choices on code dimensions, but also
are rich in redundant rows.
The organization of the rest of this paper is as follows: First,
we present the characterization of QC codes in the Fourier
transform domain in Section II. Then, we analyze ranks and
row-redundancy of QC-LDPC codes in terms of transform
domain in Section III. Later, we show that row-redundancy
can increase the performance of QC-LDPC codes. In Section
IV, we construct a class of QC-LDPC codes based on random
partitions of ﬁnite ﬁelds. Moreover, all the simulations are
over AWGN channels with BPSK transmission. The paper is
summarized in the last section.

Abstract—This paper is concerned with general analysis on the
rank and row-redundancy of an array of circulants whose null
space deﬁnes a QC-LDPC code. Based on the Fourier transform
and the properties of conjugacy classes and Hadamard products
of matrices, tight bounds on rank and row-redundancy are
derived, which make it possible to consider row-redundancy in
constructions of QC-LDPC codes to achieve better performance.
Moreover, a new construction of QC-LDPC codes from random
partitions of ﬁnite ﬁelds, which has ﬂexible code dimensions and
is abundant in row-redundancy, is presented and analyzed.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Quasi-cyclic (QC) codes have been a challenging and
ongoing research subject in algebraic coding theory since
their introduction in late 1960’s [1]. Recent research of these
codes has been focused on a subclass of these codes, known
as QC low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which have
advantages over other types of LDPC codes in hardware implementation of encoding and decoding [2]-[4]. Furthermore,
well designed QC-LDPC codes can perform as well as any
other types of LDPC codes. Most of LDPC codes adopted as
standard codes for various next generations of communication
and storage systems are QC-LDPC codes.
A q-ary QC-LDPC code is given by the null space of an
array H of sparse circulant matrices of the same size over
a ﬁnite ﬁeld. If the array H, called the parity-check matrix,
has constant column weight γ and constant row weight ρ,
H and the code given by the null space of H are said to
be (γ,ρ)-regular, otherwise it is said to be irregular. Major
methods for constructing QC-LDPC codes, i.e., the paritycheck matrices consisting of sparse circulant matrices, can
be divided into two general categories, graph-theoretic (GT)
based and algebraic methods. To design codes, the ﬁrst step
is determining their dimensions, i.e., ranks of their paritycheck matrices. Generally the parity-check matrices of GT
QC-LDPC codes are full-rank or almost full-rank. However,
the parity-check matrices of some classes of regular algebraic
QC-LDPC codes have low rank and are rich in redundant rows.
It is well-known that degree distributions and girth are two
design criteria to optimize the performance of message-passing
decoding algorithms for LDPC codes. Row-redundancy has
been shown to have great impact on the performance of LDPC
codes. Thus, it is a potential way to improve the performance
of QC-LDPC codes. However, there is a lack of algorithms to
construct redundant rows while keeping the size of girth.
Recent development in QC-LDPC codes (QC codes in
general) is the introduction of a matrix-theoretic approach

II. C HARACTERIZATION OF QC C ODES IN THE F OURIER
T RANSFORM D OMAIN
In this section, we give a review of characterization of QC
codes in the Fourier transform domain presented in [7]. Some
new interpretations and extensions are given.
Consider a ﬁnite ﬁeld GF(q) of q = 2r elements. Let α be
an element of GF(q) with order e and a be an e-tuple over
GF(2), where e is a factor of q − 1. Due to the limited space,
we consider only the case e = q −1 in this paper. The proof of
other cases are similar. The Fourier transform of the e-tuple
a [7], [9] denoted by F[a], is given by the e-tuple b over
GF(q) whose t-th component, bt , for 0 ≤ t < e, is given by
bt = a0 +a1 αt +a2 α2t +· · ·+ae−1 α(e−1)t . The vector a, which

Since HF ,π = diag(B0 , B1 , ..., Be−1 ), then

is called the inverse Fourier transform of the vector b, denoted
by a = F −1 [b], can be retrieved using the following equation,
for 0 ≤ l < e: al = b0 + b1 α−l + b2 α−2l + · · · + be−1 α−(e−1)l .

Let A = [aij ], 0 ≤ i, j < e, be an e × e circulant over
GF(2), i.e., if every row is a cyclic-shift (one place to right)
of the row above it, including end-around. Then, we write
A = circ(a), where a is its top row, called the generator of
A. Deﬁne two e × e matrices over GF(q) as follows: V =
[α−ij ] and V−1 = [αij ], 0 ≤ i, j < e. Both matrices, V and
V−1 , known as Vandermonde matrices [9], are non-singular.
Moreover, V−1 is the inverse of V and vice versa. Taking
the matrix product VAV−1 , we obtain the following e × e
diagonal matrix over GF(q),

where the diagonal vector (b0 , b1 , ..., be−1 ) is the Fourier
transform of the generator a of the circulant of A. The
diagonal matrix AF = VAV−1 is referred to as the Fourier
transform of the circulant A. Since a is an e-tuple over GF(2),
the components must satisfy the following constraint [7]:

The m × n matrices Bi ’s on the diagonal of the array HF ,π
satisfy the conjugacy constraint. In a latter section, we will
develop a tight lower bound for computing the rank of H based
on the conjugacy constraint on matrices Bt ’s. To specify this
constraint, we introduce the concept of Hadamard product.
Let B = [bi,j ] and C = [ci,j ] be two matrices of the same
size. The Hadamard product of B and C [9], denoted by B◦C,
is deﬁned as their element-wise product, i.e., B◦C = [bi,j ci,j ].
The Hadamard product of t copies of the matrix B, where t is
a nonnegative integer, denoted by B◦t , is B◦t = [bt ] which
i,j
is referred to as the t-th Hadamard power of B. We allow t to
equal 0 and in this case b0 = 1 if bi,j is a nonzero element
i,j
in GF(q) and b0 = 0 if bi,j = 0.
i,j
For an array H of circulants and zero matrices (ZM) over
GF(2), the matrices on the main diagonal of the array HF ,π
satisfy the conjugacy constraint [7],

b(2t)e = b2

B(2t)e = B◦2 ,

AF = VAV−1 = diag(b0 , b1 , ..., be−1 ),

(2)

i.e., the entry at the location (i, j) of B(2t)e is the square of
the entry at the location (i, j) of Bt . We call the matrix B(2t)e
a conjugate matrix of Bt .
A circulant matrix whose generator has single 1-component
is called circulant permutation matrix (CPM). In most construction of parity-check matrices of QC-LDPC codes, each
circulant in H is either a CPM or a ZM. In this case, the
conjugacy constraint become

for 0 ≤ t < e, where (2t)e denotes the nonnegative integer
less than e and congruent to 2t modulo e. This condition is
known as the conjugacy constraint.
Let m and n be two positive integers. Let H = [Ai,j ]
0 ≤ i < m, 0 ≤ j < n be an m × n array of e × e circulants
Ai,j over GF(2), where ai,j is the generator of the circulant
Ai,j . Next, we deﬁne Ω(m) as an m × m diagonal array of
V’s and Ω−1 (n) as an n × n diagonal array of V−1 ’s,
Ω(m)

= diag(V, ..., V),

Then the Fourier transform of H is given as, HF =

i,j
is an e × e diagonal matrix with diagonal vector
(bi,j,0 , bi,j,1 , ..., bi,j,e−1 ) which is the Fourier transform of the
generator ai,j of Ai,j .
Deﬁne the following index sequences: for 0 ≤ i, j < e,
πrow,i = [i, e+i, ..., (m−1)e+i], and πcol,j = [j, e+j, ..., (n−
1)e + j]. Let πrow = [πrow,0 , πrow,1 , ..., πrow,e−1 ], and πcol =
[πcol,0 , πcol,1 , ..., πcol,e−1 ]. Then πrow gives a permutation of
the indices of the rows of HF and πcol gives a permutation
of the indices of columns of HF . By these permutations, HF
results in the following e × e diagonal array of m × n matrices
over GF(q),

and we can use B to denote B1 such that the construction
of H can be carried out directly from the transform domain
B = [bi,j ] (called base matrix) as follows: For each entry bi,j
in B, 1) if bi,j = 0, let bi,j = αl with 0 ≤ l < e, replace bi,j
by an e×e CPM whose generator has a single 1-component at
position l, 2) if bi,j = 0, replace bi,j by an e×e ZM. The above
construction of the RC-constrained array H directly from the
base matrix B is referred to as e-fold dispersion of B.
If the base matrix B satisﬁes the following 2 × 2 submatrix
(SM)-constraint speciﬁed by the following theorem, then the
parity-check matrix H of the QC-LDPC code satisﬁes the RCconstraint and its Tanner graph has a girth at least 6. A proof
can be found in [7]. Such a base matrix B is called a 2 × 2
SM-constrained base matrix.

Theorem 1. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for an array
H of CPM’s and/or ZM’s to satisfy the RC-constraint is that
every 2 × 2 submatrix in the base matrix B contains at least
one zero entry or is non-singular.

III. R ANK AND ROW- REDUNDANCY A NALYSIS
In this section, we give a general analysis of the rank and
row-redundancy of the parity-check matrix of a binary QCLDPC code in the Fourier transform domain. In [8], we will

following inequality:

show that it is amicable for existing codes, e.g., Latin square
codes, multiplicative group codes and additive group codes,
not only binary, but also nonbinary.
The row-redundancy of a matrix is deﬁned as the ratio of the
number of redundant rows (or dependent rows) of the matrix
to the total number of rows of the matrix. It is well-known that
row-redundancy speeds up the rate of decoding convergence
[10]. We will show later that it also improves the performance.

Consider the class Ψi = {B◦ti , B◦2ti , ..., B◦2
conjugate matrices. It follows from our construction of the
cyclotomic cosets that ti is the smallest integer in Zi . Hence,
B◦ti is the representative matrix of the conjugacy class Ψi .
Then ti − 1 must be contained in the i∗ th cyclotomic coset
Zi∗ with i∗ < i. Thus, B◦(ti −1) is a member matrix in the
conjugacy class Ψi∗ with representative B◦ti∗ where ti∗ is
the representative in the cyclotomic coset Zi∗ . Since i∗ < i
and ti∗ ≤ ti − 1, then we must have ti∗ < ti . Since the
rank of the matrices in conjugacy class Ψi∗ is µi∗ , then
rank(B◦(ti −1) ) = µi∗ . It follows from

A. Rank Analysis
If H is an array of circulants and ZM’s over GF(2), based
on the conjugacy constraint speciﬁed by (7), it can be readily
proved by induction that for any integers t > 0,

(9)

From (9) we can group the e matrices B0 , B1 , ..., Be−1 into
conjugacy classes. Let λ be the number of distinct conjugacy
classes and Ψ0 , Ψ1 , ..., Ψλ−1 denote these classes, where Ψ0
contains only the matrix B0 and Ψ1 contains B1 and its
conjugate matrices. For 0 ≤ i < λ, let ci be the number
of matrices in the conjugacy class Ψi , where ci is the smallest
nonnegative integer such that (2ci t)e = t. Suppose Bti is
member matrix in Ψi , then it follows from (9) that

B◦ti = B ◦ B◦(ti −1)

(12)

and Theorem 3 that the rank of B◦ti is upper bounded by
rank(B◦ti ) ≤ min{m, n, µ1 × µi∗ }.

(13)

From (10) and (13), we obtain an upper bound on the rank of
the parity-check matrix H which is given by the next theorem.

Theorem 2. Let B be an m × n matrix over GF(q). For
t
any nonnegative integer t ≤ r, the matrix B◦2 (the 2t -th
Hadamard power of B) has the same rank as B.

In [8], we provide details to construct cyclotomic cosets
systematically by a table.
Next we derive a straightforward upper bound on rank(H)
which only depends on the size and the ranks of B0 and B.
Consider the t-th Hadamard power B◦t of the base matrix B
for 0 < t < e. Let τ (t) denote the number of 1’s in the binary
representation of t and f0 , f1 ..., fτ (t)−1 denote the position of
these 1’s. Then

Proof: Omitted. Please refer to [8] for details.
For 0 ≤ i < λ, let µi be rank of the matrices in the
conjugacy class Ψi . Then it follows from (6) that the rank
of the parity-check matrix H is given by
rank(H) = µ0 + c1 µ1 + ... + cλ−1 µλ−1 .

t=

If we know c0 , c1 , ..., cλ−1 and µ0 , µ1 , ..., µλ−1 , then we can
compute the rank of H from (10). This can be done by ﬁrst
partitioning the set {B0 , B1 , B2 , ..., B(e−1) } into λ conjugacy
classes Ψ0 , Ψ1 , ..., Ψλ−1 and determining the rank of the
conjugate matrices in each class. Then, use (10) to compute
the rank of H. This can be carried out systematically. (The
procedure is omitted. Please refer to [8] for details).
If H is an m × n array of CPM’s and ZM’s of size e × e,
an upper bound on the rank of H can be derived which is
amicable to the analyses of rank and redundancy. First, we
need the following theorem which was proved in [8].

(15)

i=0

The number τ (t) is called the weight of the integer t. Since
0 < t < e = 2r − 1, we have 1 ≤ τ (t) < r. Using the above
binary representation of t, the t-th Hadamard power B◦t of the
base matrix B can be expressed as the following Hadamard

Since each term in the product of (16) is a conjugate matrix
of the base matrix B, they are all in the same conjugacy class
with B as the representative and hence they have the same
rank µ1 as B. It follows from Theorem 3 and (16) that the

Theorem 3. Let M1 and M2 be two m × n matrices

In this section, we present a new algebraic method for
constructing a class of QC-LDPC codes. Given a ﬁnite ﬁeld,
we ﬁrst partition the elements of the ﬁeld into two disjoint
subsets (any partition). Based on these two disjoint subsets,
we form a matrix over the given ﬁeld. Every entry of the
matrix is a sum of two elements, one from one subset and the
other from the second subset. From this matrix, we can form
a matrix consisting of CPM’s and ZM’s, which satisﬁes the
RC-constraint. Then, its null space gives a QC-LDPC code.
Recall that α is a primitive element of GF(q). Let m and
n be two positive integers such that m + n ≤ 2r . Partition
these m + n elements of GF(q) into two disjoint subsets,
G1 = {λ0 , λ1 , ..., λm−1 } and G2 = {δ0 , δ1 , ..., δn−1 }, i.e.,
G1 ∩ G2 = φ. Form the following m × n matrix over GF(q):

rank of B◦t is upper bounded as follows:

(17)

Since for 0 < i ≤ r − 1, there are r nonzero integers less
i
than e with weight i. Then based on (6) and (17) we derive
the following theorem that gives an upper bound on the rank
of an array of CPM’s and/or ZM’s of size e × e.

Brp = [λi + δj ] ,

Theorem 5. Let H be an m × n array of CPM’s and ZM’s
over GF(2) of size e × e given by the e-fold dispersion of an
m × n matrix over GF(q) with q = 2r and e = 2r − 1. Let µ0
and µ1 be the ranks of B0 = B◦0 and B, respectively. Then,
the rank of H is upper bounded as follows:
r−1

rank(H) ≤ µ0 +
i=1

min{m, n, µi }.

where 0 ≤ i < m and 0 ≤ j < n. We note that each row
of Brp is formed by adding an element in G1 to all the n
elements in G2 and each column of Brp is formed by adding
an element in G2 to all the m elements in G1 . Since the
characteristic of the ﬁeld GF(q) is 2, every element in GF(q)
is its own additive inverse. From the fact that G1 and G2
are disjoint and the formation of Brp , we readily prove that:
1) all the entries in Brp are nonzero; 2) all the entries in a
row of Brp are different; and 3) all the entries in a column
of Brp are different. Every entry in Brp is a power of the
primitive element α of GF(q). In the following, we prove that
the m × n matrix Brp over GF(q) given by (20) satisﬁes the
2 × 2 SM-constraint.

(18)

The upper bound given by (18) depends only on the choice
of the base matrix B. For most of 2 × 2 SM-constrained base
matrices, this bound is very tight. If the base matrix B has
special structures, a combinatorial expression for rank(H) can
be derived, which will be shown in [8].
B. Row-Redundancy

Theorem 6. The m × n matrix Brp over GF(q) given by (19)
satisﬁes the 2 × 2 SM-constraint.

Deﬁnition 1. Let H be an m × n matrix over GF(2). Let
rank(H) denote the rank of H. The row-redundancy of H is
deﬁned as the ratio ξ = (m − rank(H))/m. If H has full
rank, i.e., rank(H) = m, then its row-redundancy is zero.

Proof: Omitted. Please refer to [8] for details.
Since the base matrix Brp over GF(q) satisﬁes the 2 × 2
SM-constraint. It can be used to construct an m × n RCconstrained binary array Hrp of CPM’s and ZM’s. Since each
entry in Brp is a nonzero element in GF(q), it must be a
power of α which is a primitive element of GF(q). Then the
construction of Hrp is directly from the e-fold dispersion of
Brp . Since all the entries are nonzero, Hrp contains no ZM.
Hrp is an me×ne matrix over GF(2). Since each CPM has
both column and row weights equal to 1, the column and row
weights of Hrp are m and n respectively. Consequently, the
null space of Hrp gives an RC-constrained QC-LDPC code
of length ne with minimum distance at least m + 1 whose
Tanner graph has a girth at least 6. Clearly, there are many
combinations of m and n such that it is ﬂexible to design
codes with various length and dimension. Moreover, the null
space of any sub-array of Hrp also gives a QC-LDPC code.

It follows from the above deﬁnition that m − rank(H) is
simply the number of redundant rows of H, denoted by R(H).
Using the upper bound on the rank of the parity-check matrix
H given by (18), we obtain the following lower bound on

QC-LDPC codes with large R(H) have been reported in [10],
[11], which are all constructed by array dispersions of 2 ×
2 SM-constrained base matrices using ﬁnite ﬁelds. They are
arrays of CPM’s and/or ZM’s. Here we would like to show
the impact of row-redundancy by an simple example of the
(255, 175) EG-LDPC code given in [10]. From Fig. 1, it is
clear that the performance of the SPA decoding algorithm[13]

Next we will analyze the rank to show that the resulting
parity-check matrix is rich in redundant rows. First, because
there are no zero elements in Brp , B0 is an all ‘1’ matrix and
has rank µ0 = 1. Second, we will show that the rank of Brp
is small µ1 = min{m, n, 2} in [8]. From Theorem 5, an upper

Furthermore,in [8], we construct a (4, 8) LDPC code deﬁned
by the null space of a 120 × 240 parity-check matrix with
10 redudant rows, whose performance of the SPA decoding
algorithm [13] is 0.2 dB better than two γ = 4 PEG codes
[12] at BER 10−5 , as shown in Fig. 3.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

In [8], we will prove that for parity-check matrices constructed
based on random partitions, the equality holds in most cases.
Also, we will show that Theorem 5 is tight and the equality
holds for many classes of QC-LDPC codes in [8].

Example 1. Let GF(26 ) be the ﬁeld for construction. Let α be
a primitive element of GF(26 ). Partition GF(26 ) into two subsets, G1 = {0, 1, α, α2 , α3 , α4 } and G2 = {α5 , α6 , ..., α62 }.
Using these two subsets, we can construct a 6 × 58 base
matrix Brp over GF(26 ). Array dispersion of this base matrix
results in a 6 × 58 array Hrp of 63 × 63 CPM’s. Hrp is a
378 × 3654 RC-constrained matrix over GF(2) with column
and row weights 6 and 58, respectively. We ﬁnd that the rank of
Hrp is 319, which is exactly bounded by (21). Hence, the null
space of Hrp gives a (6,58)-regular (3654,3335) QC-LDPC
code with rate 0.9126. The bit and block error performances
of the code decoded with 5, 10 and 50 iterations of the MSA
[13] are shown in Fig. 2. We see that the decoding of the
code converge fast. At the BER 10−6 , the code decoded with
50 iterations of the MSA perform 1.2 dB from the Shannon
limit. At the BLER (block error rate) 10−5 , it performs 0.8 dB
from the sphere packing bound.
V. C ONCLUSION AND R EMARKS
Thanks to the rank analyses [5]-[6] based on the Fourier
transform, we could expand the rank analysis and rowredundancy into all QC-LDPC codes. It is possible to take
row-redundancy into account in code constructions such that
structured QC-LDPC codes can achieve better performance.
Furthermore, we presented a class of 2 × 2 SM-constrained
base matrices which are constructed based on partitions of
ﬁnite ﬁelds of characteristic of 2. QC-LDPC codes deﬁned
by the null space of these base matrices are ﬂexible for
