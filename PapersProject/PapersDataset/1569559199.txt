Abstract—A factor-graph representation of quantum-mechanical probabilities is proposed. Unlike standard statistical models,
the proposed representation uses auxiliary variables (state variables) that are not random variables.

Statistical models with many variables are often represented
by factor graphs [1]–[4] or similar graphical representations
[5]–[7]. Such graphical representations can be helpful in
various ways, including elucidation of the model itself as well
as the derivation of algorithms for statistical inference.
So far, however, quantum mechanics (e.g., [8], [9]) has
been standing apart. Despite being a statistical theory, quantum mechanics does not seem to ﬁt into standard statistical
categories. Indeed, it has often been emphasized that quantum
mechanics is a generalization of probability theory that cannot
be understood in terms of “classical” statistical modeling.
In this paper, we propose the different perspective that the
probabilities in quantum mechanics are quite ordinary, but
their state-space representation is of a type not previously used
in statistical modeling. In particular, we propose a factor-graph
representation of quantum mechanics that correctly represents
the joint probability distribution of any number of measurements. Like most statistical models, the proposed factor graphs
use auxiliary variables (state variables) in addition to the
actually observed variables; however, in contrast to standard
statistical models, the auxiliary variables in the proposed factor
graphs are not random variables. Nonetheless, the probabilities
of the observations are marginals of the factor graph, as in
standard statistical models.
The paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews
factor graphs and their connection to linear algebra and tensor
diagrams. Section III makes the pivotal observation that factor
graphs with complex factors and with auxiliary variables
that are not random variables can represent probability mass
functions. The main results are given in Section IV.
We will use standard linear algebra notation rather than
the bra-ket notation of quantum mechanics. The Hermitian
transpose of a complex matrix A will be denoted by AH = AT ,
where AT is the transpose of A and A is the componentwise
complex conjugate. An identity matrix will be denoted by I.

alphabets and all functions take values in C. We will use
Forney factor graphs (also called normal factor graphs) as
in [2], [3] where nodes/boxes represent factors and edges
represent variables. For example, assume that some function
f (x1 , . . . , x5 ) can be written as
f (x1 , . . . , x5 ) = f1 (x1 , x2 , x5 )f2 (x2 , x3 )f3 (x3 , x4 , x5 ). (1)
The corresponding factor graph is shown in Fig. 1.
The Forney factor-graph notation is intimately connected
with the idea of “closing boxes” by summing over internal variables [2]. For example, closing the inner dashed
box in Fig. 2 replaces the two nodes/factors f2 (x2 , x3 ) and
f3 (x3 , x4 , x5 ) by the single node/factor
g(x2 , x4 , x5 ) =

f2 (x2 , x3 )f3 (x3 , x4 , x5 );

closing the outer dashed box in Fig. 2 replaces all nodes/
factors in (1) by the single node/factor
f (x1 , x4 ) =

and closing ﬁrst the inner dashed box and then the outer dashed
box replaces all nodes/factors in (1) by

II. O N FACTOR G RAPHS AND M ATRICES
Factor graphs represent factorizations of functions of several
variables. In this paper, all variables take values in ﬁnite

Factor graph of the hidden Markov model (9) for n = 3.

The factor graph of (9) is given in Fig. 5. (As shown in
this example, variables in factor graphs are often denoted
by capital letters [2].) Closing the dashed box in Fig. 5
yields p(y1 , . . . , yn ), the probability mass function of the
observables.
As illustrated by this example, auxiliary variables in statistical models are often introduced in order to obtain nice
state-space models.
In traditional statistical models, such auxiliary state variables are themselves random variables, and the total model
is a joint probability law over all variables as, e.g., in (9).
(A statistical model may also contain parameters in addition
to auxiliary random variables, but such parameters are not
relevant for the present discussion.)
The ﬁrst main point of this paper is this: requiring the
auxiliary state variables to be random variables may be unnecessarily restrictive. The beneﬁts of state-space representations
may be obtained by merely requiring a function f (y, x) (with
a useful factorization) such that the probability mass function
of the observables is

p(y) =

f (y, x);

which is the closed-box function (the external function) of
Fig. 3. Note that the identity matrix corresponds to an equality
constraint function f= (x, y).
In this notation, the trace of a square matrix A is
tr(A) =

p(yk , xk |xk−1 ). (9)

The multiplication of two matrices A and B can then be
written as
A(x, y)B(y, z),

Y3

p(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xn ) = p(x0 )

The corresponding node (which is denoted by “=”) can serve
as a branching point in a factor graph, cf. Figs. 7–11.
A matrix A ∈ Cm×n may be viewed as a function
{1, . . . , m} × {1, . . . , n} → C : (x, y) → A(x, y).

Note the equality between (4) and (3), which holds in general:
closing an inner box within some outer box (by summing over
its internal variables) does not change the closed-box function
of the outer box.
A half edge in a factor graph is an edge that is connected
to only one node (such as x1 in Fig. 1). The external function
of a factor graph (in [12]–[14] also called partition function)
is deﬁned to be the closed-box function of a box that contains
all nodes and all full edges, but all half edges stick out (such
as the outer box in Fig. 2). The external function of Fig. 1
is (3).
The equality constraint function f= is deﬁned as

(AB)(x, z) =

III. S TATISTICAL M ODELS WITH AUXILIARY VARIABLES
U SING C OMPLEX FACTORS
Statistical models usually contain auxiliary variables in
addition to the observable variables. Consider, for example,
a hidden Markov model with observables Y1 , . . . , Yn and
auxiliary variables (hidden variables) X0 , X1 , . . . , Xn such
that

the function f (y, x) need not be a probability mass function
and it need not even be real valued.
For example, consider the factor graph in Fig. 6, where all
factors are complex valued. Note that the lower dashed box
in Fig. 6 mirrors the upper dashed box, but all factors in the
lower box are the complex conjugates of the corresponding
factors in the upper dashed box. The closed-box function of
the upper dashed box is

(8)

x

which is the external function (which is a constant) of the
factor graph in Fig. 4. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the graphical
proof of the identity tr(AB) = tr(BA), which is much used
in quantum mechanics.
Factor graphs for linear algebra operations such as Fig. 3
and Fig. 4 (and the corresponding generalizations to tensors)
are essentially tensor diagrams (or trace diagrams) as in
[10], [11]. This connection between factor graphs and tensor
diagrams was noted in [12]–[14].

g(y1 , y2 , y3 ) =

g1 (x1 , y1 )g2 (x1 , x2 , y2 )g3 (x2 , y3 ) (11)

and the closed-box function of the lower dashed box is
g1 (x1 , y1 ) g2 (x1 , x2 , y2 ) g3 (x2 , y3 ) = g(y1 , y2 , y3 ).

It is clear from Section III that the external function of
Fig. 7 (with measurements as in Fig. 8 or as in Fig. 11)
is real and nonnegative. We now proceed to analyze these
factor graphs and to verify that they yield the correct quantummechanical probabilities p(y1 , y2 ) for the respective class of
measurements. To this end, we need to understand the closedbox functions of the dashed boxes in Fig. 9. We begin with
the dashed box on the right-hand side of Fig. 9, where Y2 is
assumed to be unknown.

If follows that the closed-box function in Fig. 6 (with both
dashed boxes closed) is
g(y1 , y2 , y3 )g(y1 , y2 , y3 ) = |g(y1 , y2 , y3 )|2 ,

(15)

Proposition 1. Closing the dashed box on the right-hand side
in Fig. 9 (with a measurement of Y2 as in Fig. 8 or as in
Fig. 11, but with unknown result of the measurement) reduces
it to an equality constraint function.

(13)

which is real and nonnegative and thus suitable to represent a
probability mass function p(y1 , y2 , y3 ) (up to a scale factor).
We will see that factor graphs as in Fig. 6—with two parts,
one part being the complex conjugate mirror image of the
other part—can represent probabilities in quantum mechanics.

The proof of this proposition and the proofs of the subsequent
propositions are easy, and are omitted due to space constraints.
Proposition 1 guarantees, in particular, that a future measurement (with as yet unknown results) does not inﬂuence
present or past observations.
The proposition clearly holds also for the extension of Fig. 7
to any ﬁnite number of measurements Y1 , Y2 , . . . and can then
be applied recursively from right to left.
Applying reductions according to Proposition 1 recursively
from right to left in Fig. 7 leads to the following proposition.

IV. FACTOR G RAPHS FOR Q UANTUM M ECHANICS
Consider the factor graph of Fig. 7. In this ﬁgure, U0 and U1
are M × M unitary matrices, and all variables except Y1 and
Y2 take values in the set {1, . . . , M }. The two large boxes in
the ﬁgure represent measurements, as will be detailed below.
The factor/box p(x0 ) is a probability mass function over the
initial state X0 . We will see that this factor graph (with suitable
modeling of the measurements) represents the joint probability
mass function p(y1 , y2 ) of a general M -dimensional quantum
system with two observations Y1 and Y2 . The generalization
to more observed variables Y1 , Y2 , . . . is obvious.
The unitary matrices U0 and U1 in Fig. 7 represent the
development of the system between the initial state and the
ﬁrst measurement, or between measurements, respectively,
according to the Schr¨ dinger equation.
o
In the most basic case, the initial state X0 = x0 is known
and the measurements look as shown in Fig. 8, where the
matrices B1 and B2 are also unitary. In this case, the observed
variables Y1 and Y2 take values in {1, . . . , M } as well. Note
that the lower part of this factor graph is the complex conjugate
mirror of the upper part (as in Fig. 6).
In quantum-mechanical terms, measurements as in Fig. 8 are
projection measurements with one-dimensional eigenspaces.
Note that the value of Y1 and Y2 is the index of the measured
eigenspace (rather than the corresponding eigenvalue).
A very general form of measurement is shown in Fig. 11.
In this case, the range of Yk is a ﬁnite set Yk , and for each
y ∈ Yk , the factor Ak (˜k , xk , y) corresponds to a complex
x
square matrix Ak (y) (with row index xk and column index
˜
xk ) such that
Ak (y)H Ak (y) = I
(14)

Proposition 2. The factor graph of Fig. 7 (with measurements
as in Fig. 8 or as in Fig. 11) represents a properly normalized
probability mass function, i.e., the external function p(y1 , y2 )
is real and y1 ,y2 p(y1 , y2 ) = 1.
2
Consider now the dashed box on the left in Figs. 9 and 10,
which turns out to be the density matrix of quantum mechanics. We will distinguish between the closed-box function
ρk (xk , xk ) before measuring Yk (as in Fig. 9), and the closedbox function ρk (˜k , xk ) after the observation Yk = yk (as
˜ x ˜
in Fig. 10). The former is easily seen to be properly normalized, but the latter needs normalization to satisfy (16).
The corresponding matrices will be denoted by ρk and ρk ,
˜
respectively. The proper normalization can then be expressed
by the condition
tr(ρk ) = tr(˜k ) = 1.

We have proposed a class of factor graphs that represent
quantum-mechanical probabilities involving any number of
measurements, both for basic projection measurements and for
general measurements as in [9, Chap. 2]. Such factor graphs
have not previously been used in statistical modeling.
The space constraints of this paper preclude the discussion
of further pertinent topics that we intend to address elsewhere,
including the meaning of such factor graphs from a statisticalmodeling point of view (disregarding physics), the relation to
quantum Bayesian networks (see, e.g., [15]), to quantum belief
propagation (see, e.g., [16]), and to tensor diagrams/networks
for analyzing quantum systems (see, e.g., [17]). It is also
noteworthy that quantum circuits as in [9, Chap. 4] may be
viewed as halves of factor graphs as in this paper, where the
missing other half is a complex conjugate mirror image as in
Section III.
