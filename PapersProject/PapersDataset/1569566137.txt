Abstract—A multi-way communication network with three
nodes and a relay is considered. The three nodes in this socalled Y-channel, communicate with each other in a bi-directional
manner via the relay. Studying this setup is important due to its
being an important milestone for characterizing the capacity of
larger networks. A transmit strategy for the Gaussian Y-channel
is proposed, which mimics a previously considered scheme for the
deterministic approximation of the Y-channel. Namely, a scheme
which uses nested-lattice codes and lattice alignment is used, to
perform network coding. A new mode of operation is introduced,
named ‘cyclic communication’, which interestingly turns out to
be an important component for achieving the capacity region of
the Gaussian Y-channel within a constant gap.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Multi-way communications was ﬁrst studied by Shannon
in [1] where the so-called two-way channel was considered.
This setup consists of two nodes which act as transmitters
and receivers in the same time, and its capacity is not known
in general. By combining relaying and multi-way communications, we obtain the so-called multi-way relay channel.
For instance, the two-way relay channel (or the bi-directional
relay channel) consists of two nodes communicating with each
other in both directions, via a relay. This setup was introduced
in [2] and later studied in [3]–[6] leading to an approximate
characterization of the capacity region of the Gaussian case.
The multi-way relay channel with more nodes was also
studied in [7] in a multicast scenario. In [8], the common-rate
capacity of the Gaussian multi-way relay channel, where each
user multi-casts a message to all other users, was obtained
by using the so-called ‘functional decode-and-forward’. A
broadcast variant of this multi-way relaying setup, the so called
Y-channel, was considered in [9]. Each user in the Y-channel
sends two independent messages, one to each other user.
[9] considered the multiple-input multiple-output Y-channel.
Namely, 3 MIMO nodes communicate via a MIMO relay. A
transmission scheme exploiting signal space alignment [10],
[11] was proposed, and its corresponding achievable degrees
of freedom were calculated. In [12], it was shown that if
the relay has more than ⌈3M/2⌉ antennas where M is the
number of antennas at the other nodes, then the cut-set bound
is asymptotically achievable, thus characterizing the degrees
of freedom of the MIMO Y-channel under this condition.
We consider the single antenna Gaussian Y-channel. This
case is not covered in [12], and as it turns out, the statement
in [12] does not apply here. In fact, it was shown in [13] that
further bounds (other than the cut-set bounds) are required to

characterize the degrees of freedom of the single antenna Ychannel. Thus, in the single antenna case, the cut-set bounds
are not asymptotically achievable. From this point of view,
it is worth to study the capacity of the SISO Y-channel as a
separate problem.
In this paper, we propose a transmission scheme for the
Gaussian Y-channel which utilizes nested-lattice codes in a
functional decode-and-forward fashion, and derive its achievable rate region. It turns out that this scheme achieves the
capacity region of the Y-channel within a constant gap.To this
end, the system model is given in section II. A toy example
illustrating our scheme for the deterministic Y-channel is given
in Section III. The transmit strategy for the Gaussian Y-channel
is described in Section IV and we conclude with section V.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
The Y-channel is the multi-way relaying setup shown in
Fig. 1. Each user Uk sends a message to each other user via
the relay. A code for the Y-channel, an achievable rate tuple
R = (R12 , R13 , R21 , R23 , R31 , R32 ), and the 6-dimensional
capacity region is deﬁned in the classical information theoretic
sense (see [13], [14]). In our Gaussian Y-channel (GYC), the
variables are real valued. The relay receives
yri = h1 x1i + h2 x2i + h3 x3i + zri ,
in time instant i, where zri is a realization of an independent
and identically distributed Gaussian noise with zero mean
and unit variance (i.i.d. N (0, 1)) and h1 , h2 , h3 ∈ R are the
channel coefﬁcients from the users to the relay. Without loss
of generality, we assume that h2 ≥ h2 ≥ h2 . The received

signal at user j is given by

U3 , U1 and U2 , respectively, thus forming the cycle 1 → 3 →
2 → 1. Here, we use a cyclic strategy as follows. Let U1 send
c13 on both relay levels 2 and 3, U2 send c21 on relay level
3, and U3 send c32 on relay level 2. The relay thus receives
c13 ⊕ c32 and c13 ⊕ c21 on levels 2 and 3, respectively (Fig.
2). It then forwards these sums on levels 3 and 4 (3). Each
receiver receives c13 ⊕ c21 and c13 ⊕ c32 , and by adding them
up, it can construct c32 ⊕ c21 . Then, given its transmitted bit,
each receiver is able to calculate the other two bits of the
cyclic information ﬂow, which achieves Rc .
Finally, Ru can be easily achieved using a uni-directional
strategy. Here, U1 and U2 send one bit each, u13 and u21 ,
to levels 5 and 4 at the relay, respectively (Fig. 2). The relay
forwards these bits on levels 2 and 5, respectively, and users U1
and U3 are then able to recover both desired bits. This achieves
Ru and consequently, we have achieved the rate tuple R.
The given scheme consumed all the levels at the relay to
achieve R (see Fig. 2 and 3). If we replace the cyclic strategy,
which uses 2 levels at the relay for communicating 3 bits, by
the uni-directional strategy, then we do not leave enough levels
free to achieve Ru . This shows the importance of the cyclic
strategy. Finally, we note that it was shown in [14] that the
given scheme achieves the capacity region of the DYC. In the
next section, we extend this scheme to the Gaussian case, with
the aid of nested-lattice codes.

yji = hj xri + zji ,
where xri is the relay signal at time instant i, and zji is a
realization of an i.i.d. N (0, 1) noise. The channel are assumed
to be reciprocal, and all nodes have a power constraint P , i.e.,
n

i=1 E[Xri ] ≤ P , and n
i=1 E[Xji ] ≤ P . Here, n is the
n
length of the code. To illustrate our achievable scheme for the
GYC, we start by considering a toy example for the linear-shift
deterministic [15] Y-channel (DYC) deﬁned in [14].
III. A C APACITY ACHIEVING S CHEME FOR THE DYC
In this section, we describe brieﬂy the network coding based
scheme in [14] by considering the following toy example. In
the DYC, we distinguish between three different patterns of
information ﬂow as follows:
b) Bi-directional: where Rjk and Rkj are both non-zero for
some j, k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, j = k.
c) Cyclic: where Rjk , Rkl , and Rlj are non-zero while
Rkj = Rlk = Rjl = 0 for distinct j, k, l ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
u) Uni-directional: where neither case b) nor c) holds.
A. DYC: A Toy Example
Consider the DYC shown in Fig. 2. The received signal
at the relay is given here by the mod 2 sum of the bits
arriving at each level. Let us choose the following rate tuple
R = (0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2), and see how our scheme achieves this
rate tuple. It can easily be checked, that the schemes used in
the bi-directional relay channel [5] (only cases b and u above)
do not sufﬁce to achieve this rate tuple.
We write R = Rb + Rc + Ru , where Rb = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1),
c
R = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1), and Ru = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0). Notice that
Rb resembles bi-directional information ﬂow between U2 and
U3 with a rate of 1 bit per channel use in each direction. To
achieve this rate tuple, let U2 send one bit b23 on relay level
1 in the uplink, and let U3 also send 1 bit b32 on the same
level (Fig. 2). Thus, the relay receives b23 ⊕ b32 on level 1.
The relay then forwards b23 ⊕ b32 on the highest level in the
downlink (Fig. 3). Upon receiving b23 ⊕b32 , U2 and U3 are able
to extract their desired bits, b32 and b23 , respectively, which
achieves Rb . We call this strategy the bi-directional strategy.
The rate tuple Rc resembles cyclic information ﬂow, where
U1 , U2 , and U3 want to send 1 bit each c13 , c21 , and c32 to

IV. T HE GYC: A N ACHIEVABLE S CHEME
We adapt the scheme in Section III to the Gaussian case.
Namely, we utilize network coding realized with lattice codes
[16] to mimic the DYC scheme. We start with a brief introduction on lattice codes, before proceeding to describe the
achievable scheme.
A. Nested-lattice codes
A lattice Λ with n-dimensions is a subset of Rn , where
λ1 , λ2 ∈ Λ ⇒ λ1 + λ2 ∈ Λ. The fundamental Voronoi of Λ,
V(Λ), is the Voronoi region around the origin. Nested-lattice
codes are constructed using two lattices, a coarse lattice Λc
and a ﬁne lattice Λf where Λc ⊂ Λf . We denote a nestedlattice code by the pair (Λf , Λc ), where the codewords are
chosen as the points λf ∈ Λf ∩ V(Λc ). The power and the
rate of such code is deﬁned by Λc and by the size of the set

Now, U2 sends m23 encoded in two different signals: one

DYC (Section III). Alignment is guaranteed using the nestedlattice construction, in a similar way as for the bi-directional
messages (Section IV-B1). Namely, U2 maps mc to cn =

the following result from [6].
Assume that two nodes A and B, with messages mA
and mB , respectively, want to exchange these messages via
a relay node. The two nodes use the same nested-lattice
codebook (Λf , Λc ) with power P , and rate R to encode their
messages to xn = (λk − dk ) mod Λc , k ∈ {A, B}, where

1) Encoding bi-directional messages: The users use nestedlattices to encode the bi-directional messages. Let us consider

V. C ONCLUSION
A transmission scheme is proposed for the Y-channel by
using network coding ideas. The achievability scheme is based
on three different strategies, a bi-directional, a cyclic, and a
uni-directional strategy. While the ﬁrst and the last are used
to establish the capacity of the bi-directional relay channel,
the second is new. Nested-lattices have been used to establish
network coding. The achievable rate region of the given
scheme is given. It turns out that the given scheme achieves
the capacity region within a constant gap.

before decoding at U2 . Moreover, all the nodes can use
different decoding orders to enlarge the inner bound. We do
not consider these possibilities in this paper due to lack of
space, however, the given scheme is sufﬁcient for the main
result of the paper given next.
The given scheme achieves, within a constant gap of 7/6

following region is achievable.
