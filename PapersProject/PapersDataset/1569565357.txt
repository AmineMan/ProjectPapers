Abstract—We study the vector Gaussian CEO problem, and
provide an outer bound for its rate-distortion region. We obtain
our outer bound by evaluating an outer bound for the multiterminal source coding problem by means of a technique relying
on the de Bruijn identity and the properties of the Fisher
information. Next, we address the tightness of our outer bound,
and show that our outer bound does not provide the ratedistortion region in general. In particular, we provide a speciﬁc
example where the rate-distortion region is strictly contained in
our outer bound.

We study the vector Gaussian CEO problem, where there is
a vector Gaussian source which is observed through some linear additive vector Gaussian channels by an arbitrary number
of agents. The agents process their observations independently
and communicate them to a central unit (the so-called CEO)
through orthogonal and rate-limited links (see Figure 1). The
goal of the agents is to describe their observations to the CEO
in a way that the CEO can reconstruct the source within a
given distortion. The trade-off between the rate spent by the
agents and the distortion attained by the CEO is characterized
by the rate-distortion region, which is unknown in general.
The CEO problem is introduced in [1] for a discrete
memoryless setting, where the CEO is interested in estimating
a discrete source with the minimum Hamming distance. The
scalar Gaussian CEO problem is introduced in [2], where
there is a scalar Gaussian source which is observed through
some linear Gaussian channels by the agents. The CEO wants
to estimate the Gaussian source with the minimum mean
square error (MMSE). In [2], it is shown that the MMSE
decays inversely proportionally with the rate expenditure of
the agents, for sufﬁciently large number of agents. The scalar
Gaussian CEO problem is further studied in [3], [4], where the
entire rate-distortion region is characterized. The achievability
of this region follows from the Berger-Tung inner bound [5],
and the converse proof relies on the entropy-power inequality.
Recently, [6] provided an alternative proof for the sum-rate
of the scalar Gaussian CEO problem without invoking the
entropy-power inequality.
Although entropy-power inequality is useful to provide
converse proofs for scalar Gaussian problems, it might be
restrictive for vector Gaussian problems [7], [8]. For the

vector Gaussian CEO problem, this observation is noticed
in [9], where a lower bound for the sum-rate of the vector
Gaussian CEO problem is proposed by using the entropypower inequality. This lower bound is shown to be tight
under certain conditions, although it is not tight in general.
Recently, [10] provided an outer bound for the rate-distortion
region of the vector Gaussian CEO problem when there are
only two agents. The outer bound in [10] is obtained by using
a generalized version of the extremal inequality in [11].
Since the outer bound in [10] relies on the extremal inequality in [11], the generalization of this outer bound [10]
to more than two agents requires the generalization of the
extremal inequality in [11] as well. Here, we generalize the
outer bound in [10] to an arbitrary number of agents without
any recourse on the extremal inequality in [11]. To this end, we
ﬁrst consider the outer bound provided in [12] for the multiterminal source coding problem, and evaluate it for the vector
Gaussian CEO problem at hand. In this evaluation, we use the
de Bruijn identity [13], a connection between the differential
entropy and the Fisher information, along with the properties
of the MMSE and the Fisher information. This evaluation
technique which relies on the de Bruijn identity is useful in
the sense that it is able to alleviate some shortcomings of
the entropy-power inequality in vector Gaussian problems [8],
[14].
Next, we address the tightness of our outer bound, and show
that neither our outer bound nor the outer bound in [10], which
is, in fact, a special case of our outer bound, provides the
rate-distortion region in general. To show this, we provide a
speciﬁc example, where the rate-distortion region is strictly
contained in our outer bound. In particular, we consider the
parallel Gaussian model, for which we obtain the entire ratedistortion region explicitly by using the outer bound in [12].

We then show that the rate-distortion region of the parallel
Gaussian model is strictly contained in outer bound, which
implies that our outer bound is not tight in general.
Finally, we note that in our set-up (see Figure 1), the agents
observe the vector Gaussian source X through only an additive
Gaussian noise, i.e., their observations are Y = X + N .
However, our outer bound can be generalized to a broader
model [15], [16], where the agents observe some linear combinations of the vector Gaussian source through an additive
Gaussian noise, i.e., their observations are Y = H X + N .
These generalizations can be found in [17].

where the lower bound on the distortion constraint D corresponds to the MMSE matrix obtained when the CEO has
direct access to the observations of the agents {Y }L . In [17,
=1
Appendix A.2], we show that imposing the lower bound on D
in (5) does not incur any loss of generality, while imposing the
upper bound on D in (5) might incur some loss of generality.
The rate-distortion region R(D) of the vector Gaussian
CEO problem is deﬁned as the closure of all rate tuples
(R1 , . . . , RL ) that can achieve the distortion D.
The main result of this paper is the following outer bound
on the rate-distortion region R(D):

II. P ROBLEM S TATEMENT AND THE M AIN R ESULT

Theorem 1 The rate-distortion region of the Gaussian CEO
problem R(D) is contained in the region Ro (D) which is
given by the union of rate tuples (R1 , . . . , RL ) satisfying

In the CEO problem, there are L sensors, each of which
getting a noisy observation of a source. The goal of the sensors
is to describe their observations to the CEO such that it can
reconstruct the source within a given distortion. In the vector
Gaussian CEO problem, there is an i.i.d. vector Gaussian
source {Xi }n with zero-mean and covariance KX . Each

We obtain this outer bound by evaluating the outer bound

MMSE. The proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Section III.
Next, we provide the following inner bound for the ratedistortion region R(D).

Since log |·| is continuous in positive semi-deﬁnite matrices,
there exists a matrix D in the following form

We note that for both the outer bound in Theorem 1 and the
inner bound in Theorem 2, the feasible sets to which {D }L
=1
belong are identical and given by D. On the other hand,
rate bounds differ as seen through (6) and (9). Despite this
difference, there are cases where the outer and inner bounds
match, providing a complete characterization of the ratedistortion region. Here, we note a general sufﬁcient condition
under which the outer and inner bounds coincide. If the
boundary of the outer bound in Theorem 1 can be attained
by {D∗ }L matrices which achieve the distortion constraint
=1
in (7) with equality, then the outer and inner bounds match,
giving the rate-distortion region. For example, the outer and
inner bounds match for the scalar Gaussian model [17].

Moreover, using the Cramer-Rao inequality [17, Lemma 1]
and the fact that conditioning reduces MMSE, the following
bounds on D can be obtained

We evaluate this outer bound to obtain the outer bound in
Theorem 1 for L = 2. In this evaluation, we use properties of
the Fisher information, MMSE and differential entropy along
with connections among them. The corresponding background
information on these quantities can be found in [17, Section
6.1].
Now, we consider the following mutual information terms

Next, we obtain a lower bound for J−1 (X|U2 , W ), which,
in turn, will yield a lower bound for h(X|U2 , W ). To obtain
a lower bound for h(X|U2 , W ), we will use an identity
between the Fisher information matrix and the MMSE matrix,
which holds for additive Gaussian models as we have here. In
particular, using [17, Lemma 3], we can get
J−1 (X|U2 , W )

I(Y ; U |X, W ) = h(Y |X, W ) − h(Y |X, W, U )
(14)

= log |(2πe)Σ | − h(Y |X, W, U ) (15)

Using [17, Lemma 2] and the fact that jointly Gaussian
(X, W, U , Y ) maximizes h(Y |X, W, U ), we have the following bounds for the second term in (15)

Since the distortion constraints in (40) are met with equality,
the ﬁrst log(·) in (39) is always positive, and hence, we do not
need a positivity operator. We obtain the rate-distortion region
of the parallel Gaussian CEO problem in two steps. In the
ﬁrst step, we specialize the outer bound in [12] to the parallel
model. In the second step, we evaluate the outer bound we
obtain in the ﬁrst step, and show that it matches the inner
bound given in Theorem 2.
Next, we consider the case L = M = 2, and provide
an example where our outer bound strictly contains the ratedistortion region, i.e., our outer bound includes rate pairs
which are outside of the rate-distortion region. In the example
we provide, we assume that the following conditions hold:

where (34) is due to the Cramer-Rao inequality [17, Lemma 1],
(35) comes from the fact that conditioning reduces MMSE,
and (36) follows from the distortion constraint in (13). The
order in (36) gives us the desired order among D and D;
completing the proof.

Here, ﬁrst, we consider the parallel Gaussian model, and
obtain its rate-distortion region. Next, we consider a speciﬁc
parallel Gaussian model and show that our outer bound in
Theorem 1 is not tight. In other words, we show that, in
general, there are rate tuples (R1 , . . . , RL ) that lie inside our
outer bound and are not contained in the rate-distortion region.
In the parallel Gaussian model, we have the Gaussian source

contains the rate-distortion region of the vector Gaussian CEO
problem, i.e., our outer bound is not tight in general.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
Here, we study the vector Gaussian CEO problem and
provide an outer bound for its rate-distortion region. To obtain
our outer bound, we consider the rather general outer bound
for the multi-terminal source coding problem in [12], and
evaluate it for the vector Gaussian CEO problem at hand. We
accomplish this evaluation by using a technique that relies on
the de Bruijn identity along with the properties of the MMSE
and Fisher information. Next, we address the tightness of our
outer bound and show that our outer bound does not provide
the exact rate-distortion region in general. We show this by
providing an example where our outer bound strictly includes
the rate-distortion region.
