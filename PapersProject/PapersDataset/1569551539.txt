x. In several places in his paper, Szpankowski describes this
behavior of Rn as “erratic” and this qualiﬁer is, of course,
understandable.
Our purpose in this paper is to make an attempt to give
some insight into this erratic behavior of Rn by drawing an
analogy with the physics of wave diffraction. From the theory
of X–ray scattering (see, e.g., [2, Chapter 2],[14]), it is known
that if the object that causes the diffraction of an incident
wave is a perfect crystal, then the intensity proﬁle of the
scattered wave (as a function of the wavelength or the wave
number) exhibits very sharp peaks, known as Bragg peaks,
at wavelengths that correspond to full coherence, where the
optical distance differences to all scattering elements (layers
of the crystal) are exactly integer multiples of the wavelength.
This continues to be the case as long as there is enough order
in the medium such that all these distances are commensurable
and therefore have a common divisor (common unit of length),
which can serve as the fundamental wavelength. In the realm
of the average redundancy analysis, this corresponds to the
case where α is rational and the fundamental frequency of
the oscillatory term βm0 n of Rn is intimately related to
the fundamental wavelength at which there is a Bragg peak.
On the other hand, when the distances are incommensurable,
perfect coherence between all scattered waves is not achieved
at any wavelength and therefore no Bragg peaks are observed.
This is the case of strong disorder, which in the lossless source
coding problem, corresponds to the case of α irrational, where
Rn is convergent.
More concretely, the analysis of the scattered wave intensity
function is based on a very simple model of disorder, which
is due to Hendricks and Teller [5] (see also [4]). According to
the Hendricks–Teller (HT) model, the distances between every
two consecutive layers in the solid are selected independently
at random from a ﬁnite set of two or more distances. In the
simplest case, where there are only two possible distances d0
and d1 , with probabilities p and 1 − p, this random selection
process is analogous to the memoryless binary source of the
data compression problem and the parameter α of this source
plays a role analogous to that of the ratio d1 /d0 . Thus, α
irrational means that d0 and d1 are incommensurable, which

Abstract—The average redundancy of the Shannon code, Rn ,
as a function of the block length n, is known to exhibit two
very different types of behavior, depending on the rationality
or irrationality of certain parameters of the source: It either
converges to 1/2 as n grows without bound, or it may have a
non–vanishing, oscillatory, (quasi–) periodic pattern around the
value 1/2 for all large n. In this paper, we make an attempt to
shed some insight into this erratic behavior of Rn , by drawing
an analogy with the realm of physics of wave propagation, in
particular, the elementary theory of scattering and diffraction. It
turns out that there are two types of behavior of wave diffraction
patterns formed by crystals, which are correspondingly analogous
to the two types of patterns of Rn . When the crystal is perfect, the
diffraction intensity spectrum exhibits very sharp peaks, a.k.a.
Bragg peaks, at wavelengths of full constructive interference.
These wavelengths correspond to the frequencies of the harmonic
waves of the oscillatory mode of Rn . On the other hand, when the
crystal is imperfect and there is a considerable degree of disorder
in its structure, the Bragg peaks disappear, and the behavior of
this mode is analogous to the one where Rn is convergent.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The analysis of the average redundancy of lossless
codes for data compression schemes is a topic that attracted the attention of considerably many researchers
throughout the history of Information Theory (cf. e.g.,
[1],[3],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13] and many references
therein).
In [13] Szpankowski has derived the asymptotic behavior
of the average redundancy Rn , as a function of the block
length n, for the Shannon code, the Huffman code, and other
codes, focusing primarily on the binary memoryless source,
parametrized by p – the probability of zero. His analysis
revealed a rather interesting behavior of Rn , especially in
the cases of the Shannon code and the Huffman code: When
∆
α = log2 [(1 − p)/p] is irrational, then Rn converges to a
constant (which is 1/2 for the Shannon code and 3/2 − 1/ ln 2
for the Huffman code) as n → ∞. On the other hand, when
α is rational, Rn has a non–vanishing oscillatory term of
∆
the form βm0 n , where β = − log2 (1 − p), m0 is the
denominator of α = 0 /m0 in its representation as the ratio
between two integers whose greatest common divisor is 1, and
x = x − x designates the fractional part of a real number

is the case of strong disorder with no Bragg peaks and no
oscillations in Rn . On the other hand when α = d1 /d0 is
rational, we are in the (partially) ordered mode, as described
above.
From the pure mathematical point of view, the analogy
between the average redundancy problem and the diffraction problem is rooted in that at the heart of the analyzes
of both problems, there is one very simple mathematical
fact in common: Given a vector (p0 , p1 , . . . , pM −1 ) of non–
negative reals summing to unity (probabilities) and a vector
(α1 , . . . , αM −1 ) ∈ IRM −1 , the complex number
M −1

Cm = p0 +

and the results in [13] do not apply. We also assume, without
loss of generality, that p0 is the largest letter probability, so
∆
that the parameters αj = log(p0 /pj ), j = 1, . . . , M − 1 are
all non–negative.
The Shannon code for lossless data compression assigns to
every source n–tuple x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) ∈ X n a binary
codeword of length

The average redundancy of the Shannon code is deﬁned as

Rn = E { (X)} − nH

j=1

has a modulus that obviously never exceeds unity, and Cm = 1
(i.e., full coherence between all M phasors) is attained for
some integer values of m if and only if {αj } are all rational.
To see why this true, ﬁrst observe that the “if” part is obvious:
If {αj } are all rational, namely, αj = kj /nj , j = 1, . . . , M −
1, for some positive integers {kj } and {nj } (where kj and
nj are relatively prime for all j), let m0 be their common
denominator, i.e., the smallest common multiple of all {nj }.
Then clearly, Cm = 1 for all values of m which are integer
multiples of m0 , since mαj is integer for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M − 1
at the same time.1 The “only if” part follows from the simple
∆
fact that for Cm to be equal to 1, mj = mαj must be integers
for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M − 1. In other words, αj = mj /m, which
means that {αj } must all be rational. The analogy between the
Shannon code redundancy analysis and the diffraction patterns
under the HT model will center around (1) and its two types of
behavior depending on the rationality or irrationality of {αj }.
The remaining part of this short paper consists of two
more main sections. To gain some insight concerning the
derivations in [13], we present them in a somewhat sketchy
way, emphasizing the use of the simple mathematical fact
described in the previous paragraph. For reasons of simplicity,
we focus on the Shannon code and the derivation specializes
on the memoryless case. In Section 3, we bring the derivation
of the diffraction patterns of the HT model, with a focus on the
analogy with Section 2. We then describe in detail the mapping
between the two problems under discussion. Finally, in Section
4 we summarize and conclude, with a few speculations on a
possible extension to the Markov case.

Having the asymptotic expressions of Rn as in (5), already
being derived in [13] in a completely rigorous manner, it
is now instructive to present these derivations in another,
somewhat sketchy way,2 which is considerably simpler than in
[13], but still captures the essence behind the main underlying
ideas. We believe that this may help to gain, ﬁrst of all,
some intuitive insight concerning these expressions, and then
to understand also their analogy to the derivations in the wave
diffraction problem.

we have the following:

Throughout the remaining part of this paper, we use capital
letters to designate random variables (e.g., Xi ) and the corresponding lower case letters to denote speciﬁc realizations (e.g.,
xi ). Consider a ﬁnite alphabet memoryless source X1 , X2 , . . .
with alphabet X = {0, 1, 2, . . . , M − 1} and symbol probabilities {p0 , p1 , . . . , pM −1 }. We shall assume that the source is
not dydic, i.e., the probabilities {pi } are not all integer powers
of 1/2, as in the dyadic case, Rn ≡ 0, which is uninteresting,

2 While this alternative derivation is not completely rigorous, we take the
liberty to present it here, because the correctness is assured by the full proofs
in [13].
3 Note that (u) is identical to 1 − u , except when u is an integer. Since
these two periodic functions differ only in one point (in each period) and
a single point does not affect integrals, their Fourier series expansions are
identical. In the point of discrepancy, which is a discontinuity point of both
functions, the Fourier series converges to the midpoint of the jump, which is
1/2.

previous paragraph refers to the special case M = 2.

the function (1 − u ) (see footnote no. 3) with u = βm0 n.
As can easily be seen from the second line of (8), for large n,
the sequence Rn is harmonic with a fundamental frequency
ω0 = 2πm0 β. In other words, the Fourier transform of
{Rn } contains Dirac delta functions at integer multiples of ω0
(modulo 2π). We will see later on that these spectral spikes
are analogous to the Bragg peaks of the HT model.
At this point, a technical comment is in order. At ﬁrst
glance, it may seem that the above approximate expression
of Rn is asymmetric with respect to permutations of the
alphabet, because β was deﬁned as − log p0 and the choice
of the symbol x = 0 as having a special role in the last
line of (7) was completely arbitrary (we could have chosen,
of course, any other symbol j as well). However, note that
βm0 n = −m0 n log p0 is identical to −m0 n log pj for
all j = 1, . . . , M − 1 because in the rational case considered
above, the numbers {−m0 n log pj }M −1 differ from each other
j=0
by integers, and therefore their fractional parts are all the
same. Thus, the above expression of Rn is, in fact, invariant
to permutations of the alphabet.

The simplest way to think of the HT model is as a one–
dimensional model of an alloy, which is characterized by a
sequence of mass points, positioned along the real line at
random locations Z0 , Z1 , . . . , Zn−1 . The ensemble of the HT
∆
model is deﬁned in terms of the spacings ∆j = Zj − Zj−1 ,
j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, which are (n − 1) i.i.d. random variables
taking on values in a ﬁnite set {d0 , d1 , . . . , dM −1 } with
probabilities p0 , p1 , . . . , pM −1 , respectively (thus, Z0 , Z1 , . . .
is a random walk). Each point Zi contributes a scattered wave
described by the phasor e−iqZj , where in the one–dimensional
setting considered here, q can be understood as the wave
number, that is, q = 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength.
Assuming the same amplitudes at all points, the superposition
of all these contributions is then the sum U (q) = j e−iqZj ,
which can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of the
function u(z) = j δ(z − Zj ). The overall intensity of this
superposition of waves is designated by the structure function
[2, Chapter 2]

Having deﬁned αj = log(p0 /pj ), j = 1, 2, . . . , M − 1, the
expression in the square brackets is exactly Cm as was deﬁned
in (1). The behavior of Rn for large n is then as follows. If
{αj } are not all rational, then |Cm | < 1 for all m, and so,
n
limn→∞ Cm = 0, which causes the entire summation over m
to vanish for large n.4 In this case, Rn → 1/2 as n → ∞.
On the other hand, if {αj } are all rational, then there exists
an integer m such that mαj are all integers. Having denoted
by m0 the smallest positive integer with this property, it is
clear that all other integers with the same property are integer
n
multiples of m0 . Consequently, limn→∞ Cm = 1 whenever m
n
is an integer multiple of m0 and limn→∞ Cm = 0 otherwise.
Thus, having deﬁned β = − log p0 , we now have for large n,5

But this is again exactly the expression in (1), this time
with αj = dj /d0 , which as mentioned earlier, may assume
the value 1, for some integer values of m, if and only if
αj = dj /d0 are all rational, or equivalently, d0 , d1 , . . . , dM −1
are commensurable. When this is the case, then as before,
there exists an integer m for which mdj /d0 are all integers
simultaneously. Analogously to the derivation in Section 2,
let m0 be the smallest integer with this property. Then, the
Bragg peaks appear at wave-numbers qkm0 , k = 1, 2, . . .,
which correspond to wavelengths λ0 /k, where λ0 = d0 /m0 .
The analogy between the two settings is now clear: The
redundancy pattern of the Shannon code for a source with
letter probabilities p0 , . . . , pM −1 , is intimately related to the
diffraction pattern of the HT model with the same probabilities
and corresponding distances 1, log(p0 /pj ),...,log(p0 /pM −1 ).
Stated differently, the memoryless source of Section 2 is
parallel to the random selection process in the HT model
and the parameters αj = log(p0 /pj ) of the source are
analogous to distance ratios dj /d0 , j = 1, 2, . . . , M − 1. Their
rationality/irrationality dictates the mode of behavior in both
problems. The integer parameter m0 is then deﬁned in both
settings in the very same way. The partially ordered mode in
the diffraction model is parallel to the oscillatory mode of Rn
in the data compression problem, and the Bragg peaks at all
harmonics of the fundamental wave-number qm0 = 2πm0 /d0
correspond to all harmonics of the fundamental frequency
ω0 = 2πβm0 in the oscillatory component of Rn . In other
words, the parameter β is conjugate, in this sense, to 1/d0
and one can think of the oscillatory mode of Rn as a mode
of constructive interference between the harmonic waves of
its Fourier representation, where temporal the frequency ω is
in analogy to the spatial frequency (or the wave number) q in
the diffraction problem.

IV. C ONCLUSION
(14)

In this short paper, we have made an attempt to provide
some insight into the erratic behavior of the redundancy pattern
of the Shannon code for lossless data compression. The insight
we propose is rooted in the physical point of view, where the
two modes of the behavior of the redundancy patterns are
respectively analogous to partial order and complete disorder
of a wave diffraction medium, which dictates the existence
or non–existence of Bragg peaks pertaining to perfectly constructive interference. It is hoped that this physical insight
contributes to the intuitive understanding of the redundancy
of the Shannon code and perhaps other codes as well.
Finally, as a suggestion for possible future work, it would
be interesting to generalize the above analyzes to the case
of ﬁnite–state Markov sources (and indeed, Markov models
have been proposed in the diffraction setting too [5],[14]).
While we have not studied that Markov case thoroughly, it
is speculated that in this case, both in the data compression
problem and in the HT model, the role played by high powers
of Cm would be essentially replaced by high powers of state
transition probability matrix whose entries are weighted by the
appropriate complex exponentials (which depend on m). It is

If there are values of q for which |C(q)| = 1, yet C(q) = 1,
then the geometric series diverges at these points, but these
ˆ
are only points of removable discontinuity in I(q) because
for every other point, arbitrarily close to such a discontinuity
point, again |C(q)| < 1, and the geometric series converges.
The real problematic points, if any, are those where C(q) = 1
if they exist. For C(q) = 1, we have to re-derive the expression
of I(q) separately, which is very simple as I(q) is just the sum
of n2 1’s, namely, I(q) = n2 . In other words, the intensity
scales quadratically rather than linearly with n, which means
that these are extremely high peaks in I(q), namely, the Bragg
peaks.
For C(q) to take the value 1 for some q, the products qdj
must all be integer multiples of 2π. Suppose that q is such
∆
that qd0 = 2πm for some integer m, i.e., q = qm = 2πm/d0 ,
in which case we shall denote C(qm ) by Cm , as before. In
this case,

expected that what should matter then are the eigenvalues of
this matrix. More concretely, it is not difﬁcult to see that the
spectral radius, in both settings, never exceeds unity. In the
data compression problem, the critical behavior is believed
to be dictated by the existence or non–existence of integer
values {m} for which the spectral radius is exactly 1. When
such values of m exist, then Rn should have an oscillatory
behavior. In the diffraction problem, the distinction between
the two types of behavior should be dictated by the existence
of values of m for which one of the eigenvalues is exactly
equal to one.
