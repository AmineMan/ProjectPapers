Fourier domain representation of non-binary LDPC
codes
Valentin Savin
CEA-LETI, Minatec Campus, Grenoble, France, valentin.savin@cea.fr
out that this translation corresponds to the BFT-BP decoding,
thus the extended binary representation gives a Fourier domain
representation of the non-binary LDPC code. Although it
does not allow for any further complexity reduction, this
graphical representation should be useful for further analysis
of the BFT-BP decoding. Furthermore, based on the Fourier
domain representation, we introduce the concept of augmented
non-binary LDPC codes, which gives a uniﬁed framework
for rate-ﬂexible coding techniques, such as punctured codes
[8], [9], extended codes [10], or the the recently introduced
multiplicatively repeated non-binary LDPC codes [11]. The
proposed coding scheme allows ﬂexible code-rate encoding at
the transmitter, without increasing the decoder complexity at
the receiver end.
The paper is organized as follows. A brief presentation of
non-binary LDPC codes is given in Section II. Section III
introduces the extended binary representation of non-binary
LDPC codes. BP decoding over the non-binary graph and the
equivalent decoding over the extended binary representation
are discussed in Section IV. In Section V we introduce augmented non-binary LDPC codes and demonstrate their beneﬁts
in terms of rate-ﬂexibility and error-correction capabilities.
Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

Abstract—In this paper we propose a binary representation of
non-binary codes, which consists in a q-fold covering of the nonbinary graph, where q is the size of the non-binary alphabet. It is
shown that this covering graph is actually the underlying graph
of the Fourier-domain Belief-Propagation decoding, meaning that
the exchanged messages carry information about the bit-nodes of
the covering graph. Finally, a new coding scheme is proposed, in
which the bits transmitted over the channel correspond to a set
of bit-nodes of the Fourier domain representation. The proposed
coding scheme allows using the same decoder, regardless of how
many and which of the Fourier-domain bit-nodes have been
transmitted. This considerably increases the ﬂexibility of the
system, without increasing its complexity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
LDPC codes [1] are linear block codes deﬁned by sparse
parity-check matrices. They can be advantageously represented
by bipartite (Tanner) graphs [2] and decoded by means of
Bayesian inference. The decoding algorithm, referred to as
Belief-Propagation (BP), passes messages along the edges of
the graph, in both directions, which are iteratively updated
by Bayesian rules. In the non-binary case, each message is
a probability distribution vector on the code alphabet, which
gives the probabilities of the incident symbol-node being equal
to each of its possible values. The complexity, per coded
symbol, of the BP decoding scales as O(q 2 ), where q is the
size of the non-binary alphabet [3]. Yet, it can be implemented
by using Binary Fourier Transforms (BFT) [4], which allows
decreasing the decoding complexity to O(q log(q)). At the cost
of a small performance degradation, several low-complexity
decoding algorithms have been proposed in the literature,
such as the Extended-Min-Sum decoding [5] or the MinMax decoding [6], which operate in the Log Likelihood Ratio
(rather than the probability) domain. The complexity of these
algorithms scales as O(αq 2 ), where α is a constant that can
be tuned such as to achieve a desired compromise between
complexity and performance.
There is however a notable exception with regard to the
decoding complexity of non-binary LDPC codes. Over the
Binary Erasure Channel, a decoding algorithm with linear
complexity, and which was proved to provide the same performance as the non-binary BP decoding, has been proposed
in [7]. This was achieved by exploiting the extended binary
representation of the non-binary code, which consists in a qfold covering of the non-binary graph.
The goal of this paper is to translate the non-binary BP
decoding into a decoding algorithm operating on the extended
binary representation, regardless of the channel model. It turns

II. N ON - BINARY CODES AND THEIR BINARY IMAGE
We consider non-binary codes deﬁned over the General
Linear group GL(p, F2 ), of p × p invertible matrices with
coefﬁcients in the binary ﬁeld F2 . The code alphabet is denoted
by A = Fp , and q = 2p = |A| denotes the cardinality of A.
2
Elements X ∈ A will be referred to as (non-binary) symbols.
Writing X = (x0 , . . . , xp−1 ), we shall refer to the row vector
(x0 , . . . , xp−1 ) as the binary image of X. We use the standard
transpose notation X T to denote the corresponding column
vector. A non-binary code C ⊂ An , of length n, is deﬁned as
the kernel of a linear system with m equations:
n
T
hi,j Xj = 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , m},

C = {(X1 , . . . , Xn ) ∈ An |
j=1

where hi,j ∈ GL(p, F2 )∪{0} are binary p×p matrices, which
are either invertible or all-zero. The parity check matrix of the
code is given by:
H = (hi,j )i,j ∈ Mm×n (GL(p, F2 ) ∪ {0})
A particular case is represented by non-binary codes over
the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements, denoted by Fq . In this case,
the code alphabet is given by A = Fq . However, by ﬁxing

an isomorphism of vector spaces A
Fp , each symbol of
2
X ∈ A has a binary image (x0 , . . . , xp−1 ) ∈ Fp . Furthermore,
2
the internal ﬁeld multiplication by an element h ∈ Fq deﬁnes
a linear application h : A → A, X → h · X, which can be
identiﬁed with a binary p × p matrix, which is either invertible
(if h = 0) or all-zero (if h = 0).
The bipartite graph associated with the non-binary code C,
denoted by H, consists of n symbol-nodes and m constraintnodes1 representing respectively the n columns and the m
rows of the parity check matrix H. A symbol-node j and a
constraint-node i are connected by an edge iff hi,j = 0. Each
edge of the graph is further labeled by the corresponding nonzero entry of H. We also denote by H(j) the set of constraintnodes connected to a given symbol-node j, and by H(i) the
set of symbol-nodes connected to a given constraint-node i.

Consequently, Cbin is a binary code of length (q − 1)n, and
we have:
(q−1)n
Cbin ⊂ S n ⊂ F2
(3)
In the sequel, we aim to construct a parity check matrix of
the extended binary code Cbin , starting from the parity check
matrix H of the non-binary code C.
Deﬁnition 4: The extended binary image of a binary matrix
h ∈ Mp (F2 ) is the binary matrix h ∈ Mq−1 (F2 ) deﬁned by:
hi,j =

(here, [i] · h denotes the usual multiplication between row
vector [i] and matrix h)
Proposition 5: The binary matrix h is invertible if and only
if its extended binary image h is a permutation matrix.
Proof. For i ∈ {1, . . . , q − 1}, [i] · h is the linear combination
of rows of h with coefﬁcients given by the binary digits of i.
Therefore, h is invertible iff [i] · h = [i ] · h, for any 1 ≤ i =
i ≤ q − 1, in which case there is a unique 1 entry on each
row and column of h.

we deﬁne [k] = (k0 , k1 , . . . , kp−1 ) ∈ A to be the vector of
the binary digits of k, hence k = k0 + 2k1 + · · · + 2p−1 kp−1 .

Proposition 7: Let X, Y ∈ Fp and h ∈ GL(p, F2 ). Then:

Setting X = (x0 , . . . , xp−1 ) and X = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xq−1 ), we
ﬁnd that xk = [k] · X = [k] · (x0 , . . . , xp−1 ) is the linear
combination of the binary image of X with coefﬁcients given
by the binary digits of k. Hence, the extended binary image
of X consists of all the possible linear combinations (except
the all-zero one) of its binary image. In particular, it contains
the binary image, as x2i = xi , for all i = 0, . . . , p − 1.
Example 2: If p = 3, the extended binary image of X =
(1, 0, 1) is given by X = (1, 0, 1) · H3 = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0).
Let S be the dual Hamming code of length q − 1, which is
also referred to as the simplex code. Then, S is the vector space
spanned by the rows of Hp and, according to Deﬁnition 1, it
can be seen as the vector space constituted of the extended
binary images of all the elements X ∈ A:
S = {X | X ∈ A} ⊂ Fq−1

Proof. We prove the direct implication. Fix k ∈ {1, . . . , q − 1}
and let l ∈ {1, . . . , q − 1} be the unique integer such that
q−1

which proves the direct implication. The reverse implication
can be proven in the same manner.
Now, consider a non-binary code C deﬁned by a paritycheck matrix H. The extended binary image of H is the binary
matrix Hbin ∈ M(q−1)m,(q−1)n (F2 ) obtained by replacing
each entry hi,j of H by its extended binary image hi,j .
If (X1 , . . . , Xn ) is a non-binary codeword of C, from the

binary images of all the codewords (X1 , . . . , Xn ) ∈ C:

We note that this is a strict inclusion. However, the following
property holds.

constraint-nodes for non-binary codes, and check-nodes for binary codes.

Theorem 8: Let C be a non-binary code with parity-check
matrix H. Then

Now, assume that f is a probability distribution function
on A, meaning that f (X) ≥ 0, for any X ∈ A, and
X∈A f (X) = 1. For any k = 1, . . . , q − 1, let ek denote the
random variable equal to the k th extended bit of a non-binary
symbol drawn randomly from A according to the probability
distribution f . We deﬁne:

Cbin = ker Hbin ∩ S n
Proof. The inclusion Cbin ⊂ ker Hbin ∩ S n follows from
equations (3) and (4). Conversely, consider a binary vector
in ker Hbin ∩ S n . Since it belongs to S n , it is of the form

pk = Pr(ek = 0) − Pr(ek = 1), for k = 1, . . . , q − 1
[p] = (p0 , p1 , . . . , pq−1 ) , where by convention p0 = 1

have Hbin X1 , . . . , Xn

The vector [p] is referred to as the extended likelihood difference vector associated with f . Finally, for a given function
f : A → R, we denote by [f ] = (f0 , f1 , . . . , fq−1 ) ∈ Rq the
real vector deﬁned by fi = f ([i]). With this notation, we have:
Proposition 9: The extended likelihood difference vector is
equal to the binary Fourier transform of the corresponding
probability distribution function, that is:

= 0, as it belongs to the kernel of

Hbin . Proposition 7 implies that H(X1 , . . . , Xn )T = 0, hence
(X1 , . . . , Xn ) ∈ C and therefore X1 , . . . , Xn ∈ Cbin .
Let H be the bipartite graph associated with the non-binary
parity-check matrix H (Section II). The extended bipartite
graph, denoted by H, is deﬁned as the bipartite graph associated with the parity check matrix Hbin . Since the non-zero
entries of H are invertible, it follows from Proposition 7 that
H is a (q − 1)-fold covering graph of H. There are q − 1
extended bit-nodes in H for each symbol-node of H and
q − 1 extended parity check-nodes in H for each constraintnode of H. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondance
between the neighborhood of an extended bit-node (resp.
extended parity-check node) in H and the neighborhood of
the corresponding symbol-node (resp. constraint-node) in H.
According to the terminology in [12], H may be seen as a
protograph and H as a derived graph. Hence, the binary code
associated with H is a protograph code. From Theorem 8, it
follows that there is a one-to-one correspondance between the
non-binary codewords of H and the binary codewords of H
that are further constrained by a simplex code (that is, bits
lying over the same symbol-node of H must form a simplex
codeword).

It also follows that [f ] = BFT([p]).

Proof. Let i ∈ {0, . . . , q − 1} and X = [i] ∈ A. Hence,
fi = f (X). For any k = 0, . . . , q−1, let xk = X ·[k] = [i]·[k].
We have x0 = 0 and, according to (1), X = (x1 , . . . , xq−1 ).

A. Belief propagation decoding on the non-binary graph H
We consider a non-binary codeword [X] = (X1 , . . . , Xn )
that is sent through a noisy channel, and we denote by [Y ] the
channel output. For any j = 1, . . . , n, let αj = (αj (X))X∈A
denote the probability distribution of the j th transmitted symbol, conditioned on the observed channel output:

IV. B ELIEF PROPAGATION DECODING
Non-binary LDPC codes can be decoded by iterative algorithms that pass messages along the edges of the bipartite
graph H (in both directions). For the BP decoding, each
message is a probability distribution vector over the non-binary
alphabet A, which gives the probability of the symbol-node
incident to the edge being equal to any of its possible values.
These probability distributions are updated at each iteration,
until a codeword has been found (all constraint-nodes are
veriﬁed) or a maximum number of iterations has been reached.
Our goal is to propose an equivalent decoding algorithm that
exchanges messages along the edges of the extended graph H.
To this end, given some probability distribution f on A, we
have to determine the probability of an extended bit being
equal to 0 or 1. We will prove that the probability distribution
on A and the probabilities of extended bits are related by a
binary Fourier transform. We recall that the binary Fourier
transform of a real-valued function f : A → R is the function
BFT(f ) : A → R deﬁned by:

The belief propagation decoding is initialized by setting

( −1)
is veriﬁed and on the messages pi,j ,l . We also note that

B. Belief propagation decoding on the extended graph H
Extended bit-nodes of the extended graph H will be denoted
by (j, l), where j = 1, . . . , n is the index of a symbol-node of
H and l = 1, . . . , q − 1 is the index of an extended bit of it.
Similarly, extended parity check-nodes of H will be denoted
by (i, k), where i = 1, . . . , m is the index of a constraintnode of H and k = 1, . . . , q − 1 is the index of an extended
parity check of it. According to Proposition 5, extended nodes
(i, k) and (j, l) are connected iff hi,j = 0 and [k]hi,j = [l].
Furthermore, we add some “virtual” extended nodes to H,
with indexes (i, 0) and (j, 0) (otherwise formulated, we allow
indexes k and l to take on the zero value). Extended bit-node
(j, 0) should be thought as the all-zero linear combination the
binary image of the symbol-node j, thus its value will be
always equal to zero. If hi,j = 0, extended nodes (i, 0) and
(j, 0) are connected in H, since [0]hi,j = [0]. Now, for k =
0, . . . , q − 1 there is exactly one l = 0, . . . , q − 1 such that
[k]hi,j = [l], therefore any extended parity check-node (i, k) is
connected to exactly one extended bit-node (j, l). The unique
l with the above property will be denoted in the sequel by
li,j,k , or simply lk if no confusion is possible.
As in the previous section, we consider a non-binary
codeword [X] = (X1 , . . . , Xn ) that is sent through a noisy
channel, and we denote by [Y ] the channel output. Let pj,l
denote the likelihood difference of the extended bit-node (j, l),
conditioned on the observed channel output:

Proof. Follows from Proposition 9.
( )
It also follows that messages βi,j , deﬁned in Section IV-A,
can actually be computed by using Proposition 10 and Theorem 11. To conclude this section, by decoding non-binary
LDPC codes over the extended graph H, we rediscovered
the Fourier domain implementation of the non-binary Belief
Propagation decoding [4]. For that reason, the extended graph
H will be also referred to as the Fourier domain representation
of the non-binary LDPC code.

Deﬁnition 12: An augmented non-binary LDPC code is a
pair (C, E), where C is a non-binary LDPC code and E is a
set of extended bit-nodes of the corresponding Fourier domain
representation. The rate of the augmented non-binary code,
denoted by r(C,E) or simply rE if no confusion is possible, is
kbin
, where kbin is the binary dimension of
deﬁned by rE =
|E|
C and |E| denotes the cardinality of E.
A communication system using an augmented non-binary
LDPC code works as follows. At the transmitter, kbin information bits (or, equivalently, kbin /p information symbols) are
encoded using the non-binary code C. The extended binary
image of the encoded codeword is then computed, and the
extended bits corresponding to the extended bit-nodes of E
are transmitted over the channel. At the receiver end, the
received signal can be decoded by using the Fourier-domain

where (xj,0 , xj,1 , . . . , xj,q−1 ) is the extended binary image of
the transmitted symbol Xj . As mentioned above, xj,0 = 0,
hence pj,0 = 1, for any j = 1, . . . , n. We also deﬁne:
[pj ] = (pj,0 , pj,1 , . . . , pj,q−1 )
and q( ) = q( )
We denote by p( ) = p( )

the messages exchanged between the extended bit-node (j, lk )
and the extended parity check-node (i, k) at iteration .
The belief propagation decoding is initialized by setting
(0)
pi,j,l = pj,l , for all i ∈ H(j) and l = 0, . . . , q − 1. Then,
for ≥ 1, exchanged messages are computed according to the
following rules:

BP decoding, or any other decoding algorithm for non-binary
LDPC codes proposed in the literature [6],[13]. Clearly, the
rate of such a coding scheme is given by rE . Depending on the
number of transmitted extended-bits, rE can be either greater
or less than the rate of the mother non-binary code C. A
signiﬁcant advantage of augmented codes is that they allow
using the same decoder, regardless of how many and which
extended bits have been transmitted.
Augmenting patterns for non-binary LDPC codes can be
optimized by density evolution, in a similar manner to the
technique proposed in [9] for optimizing puncturing patterns
for non-binary LDPC codes. Due to space limitation, this
optimization will be presented in an extended version of this
paper. However, we include below the asymptotic thresholds
over the Binary Input AWGN channel, of augmented regular
(dv = 2, dc = 4) LDPC codes over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F64 .
Density evolution of augmented non-binary LDPC codes has
been approximated by Monte-Carlo simulation, following the
method introduced in [9], which has been proven to provide
accurate (very close) and precise (small variance) estimates of
the asymptotic thresholds.
We denote by Ej (resp. kj = |Ej |) the set (resp. the number)
of extended bits transmitted for symbol-node j ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Given a target augmented rate rE , we randomly choose an
augmenting set E, with cardinality |E| = kbin /rE , such that:

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a graphical representation of
the Fourier-domain BP decoding for non-binary LDPC codes.
We showed that the messages exchanged within the BFTBP decoding carry information about the bit-nodes of a qfold covering of the non-binary graph. This representation
can be advantageously used to deﬁne rate-ﬂexible coding
schemes, namely augmented non-binary LDPC codes, which
were proven to outperform semi-regular non-binary LDPC
codes for small coding rates.

Hamming matrix Hp , determined by the columns corresponding to the kj extended bits in Ej .

Under these assumptions, the asymptotic thresholds of augmented regular (dv = 2, dc = 4) LDPC codes over F64
are presented in Figure 1. For comparison purposes, we have
also plotted the asymptotic thresholds of semi-regular nonbinary LDPC codes with constant symbol-node degree dv = 2:
according to the coding rate r speciﬁed on the abscissa, the
dv
2
¯
average check-node degree is given by dc = 1−r = 1−r ,
¯
¯
and any check-node is of degree either dc or dc . It can
be seen that augmented non-binary LDPC codes outperform
semi-regular codes for small coding rates (r < 0.3).
To explain this, we note that for smaller and smaller coding
rates, the best codes are deﬁned by graphs with increasingly
lower average node-degree. Figure 1 suggests that for small
coding rates, the average symbol-node degree should be further
decreased below dv = 2. However, by doing so, the graph
would necessarily contain constraint-nodes of degree 2. Such
a constraint node, say i, corresponds to an equation hi,j1 Xj1 +
hi,j2 Xj2 = 0 ⇔ Xj2 = h−12 hi,j1 Xj1 , in which case the
i,j
binary image of Xj2 is constituted of p bits from the extended
binary of Xj1 . Put differently, for small rates, good codes are
necessarily obtained by augmenting a mother code of higher
rate. We also note that the results presented in this section can
be further improved by appropriate optimization techniques.
