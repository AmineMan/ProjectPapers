for the construction of a codex then the code needs to have
some extra underlying structure in order for the codex to
be nontrivial. The second difﬁculty arises when one insists
on long codices deﬁned over a small ﬁeld. In that case
the Shamir secret sharing scheme, for which the ﬁeld size
increases with n, can no longer be used. In [5], a construction
based on algebraic geometry codes is presented for linear
secret sharing schemes deﬁned over a small ﬁeld with good
asymptotic properties for multiparty computation.

Abstract—Multiplicative linear secret sharing schemes are
the building blocks for multiparty computation protocols. Such
schemes can be deﬁned in terms of linear codes with an additional
algebraic structure. We show that Reed-Muller codes have the
required additional structure and we introduce a more general
class of Reed-Muller type codes suitable for linear secret sharing
and multiparty computation. The codes have highly structured
generator and parity check matrices that can be used for very
efﬁcient implementations over the binary ﬁeld.
Index Terms—Reed-Muller code, Linear secret sharing scheme

In this paper we investigate the multiplicative properties of
binary Reed-Muller type codes. This leads to a class of low
complexity codes over the binary ﬁeld with a rich combinatoial
structure and with good properties for short to moderate
length.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In the Shamir secret sharing scheme [1], a polynomial f
of degree at most t over a ﬁnite ﬁeld K is evaluated in n + 1
distinct ﬁeld elements x0 , x1 , . . . , xn . Through interpolation,
the value of f in x0 can be obtained from the values in
any t + 1 of the points x1 , . . . , xn . At the same time, no
information can be obtained from the values in t or fewer
points. Given a second polynomial g of degree at most t, the
product f (x0 )g(x0 ) can be obtained through interpolation
from 2t + 1 of the values f (x1 )g(x1 ), . . . , f (xn )g(xn ).

II. R EED -M ULLER CODES
We ﬁrst describe the codex structure of Reed-Muller codes.
The binary Reed-Muller code RM (1, m) of length N = 2m
and dimension m + 1 is deﬁned with a generator matrix G
with 2m distinct columns (1, x1 , . . . , xm ). Let (1, 0, . . . , 0) be
the ﬁrst column and let n = N − 1 = 2m − 1 be the number
of remaining columns. For C = RM (1, m), C ⊂ K × K n
and C (d) = RM (d, m). Using the well-known relation
RM (d, m)⊥ = RM (m − 1 − d, m), we see that the code
C (m−1) ⊥ 1 and it follows that the codex C = RM (1, m) is
(m − 1, n)-reconstructing. In particular the code RM (1, 4)
is (3, n)-reconstructing. Using similar reasoning we see
that RM (1, 7) is (6, n)-reconstructing, RM (2, 7) is (3, n)reconstructing, and RM (3, 7) is (2, n)-reconstructing.

The notion of a general linear secret sharing scheme
(LSSS) is deﬁned in [2]. Of special interest for multiparty
computation (MPC) are linear secret sharing schemes with a
multiplicative structure. Such schemes are called arithmetic
secret sharing schemes in [3]. Recently this notion was
generalized into the notion of an arithmetic codex [4]. An
arithmetic codex can be described as a K-vector space
C ⊂ S × K n such that the projection of C on S is surjective
and the projection of C on K n is injective. Here S is a
K-algebra of ﬁnite dimension as a vector space over K. If we
endow K n with coordinate-wise addition and multiplication
then S × K n becomes a K-algebra and we can deﬁne the set
C (d) ⊂ S × K n as the set of all d−fold products c1 · · · cd of
elements in C. The codex C is called (d, r)−reconstructing
if the projection π(C (d) ) ⊂ S × K r on any r coordinates is
again a codex. For S = K, the Shamir secret sharing scheme
can be considered as a (2, 2t + 1)−reconstructing codex.

Note that if a code C ⊂ K × K n is selforthogonal then C (2) ⊥ 1 and thus it is (2, n)reconstructing. Namely, for (f0 g0 , f1 g1 , . . . , fn gn ) ∈ C (2)
with (f0 , f1 , . . . , fn ), (g0 , g1 , . . . , gn ) ∈ C, the coordinate
f0 g0 is uniquely determined as the opposite of the sum f1 g1 +
· · · + fn gn of the remaining coordinates. (2, n)-reconstructing
linear secret sharing schemes are called multiplicative and are
important for multiparty computation with a passive adversary.
Multiparty computation with an active adversary makes use of
strongly multiplicative linear secret sharing schemes. In that
case it is required that a product f0 g0 can be expressed as a

The construction of good codices involves at least two
difﬁculties. If a linear code C is chosen as the starting point

1

linear combination of the subset of coordinates not controlled
by the adversary. For the deﬁnition of strongly multiplicative
we refer to [2]. For this paper we use that a sufﬁcient condition
for C ⊂ K ×K n to be strongly multiplicative is that C (3) ⊥ 1.
This last condition implies in particular that C is (3, n)reconstructing.

IV. M AIN RESULTS
Over the vector ﬁeld Fn , besides the usual
2
addition, we deﬁne another operator “·” called
“coordinatewise multiplication”. It is deﬁned as follows:
for (a1 , a2 , ..., an ), (b1 , b2 , ..., bn ) ∈ Fn ,(a1 , a2 , ..., an ) ·
2
(b1 , b2 , ..., bn ) = (a1 b1 , a2 b2 , ..., an bn ). Based on this
deﬁnition, we will construct codes that can be used for
multiplicative secret sharing. First of all, we deﬁne a code
C (1) generated by matrix G

III. S TRONGLY SELF - ORTHOGONAL CODES AND SECRET
RECONSTRUCTION
N

Codes C ⊂ K with C (3) ⊥ 1 are called strongly
self-orthogonal. Write K N = K × K n . For C ⊂ K × K n ,
the ﬁrst coordinate of a word corresponds to the secret
and the remaining n coordinates are shares of the secret.
The access structure of the LSSS C ⊂ K × K n is the
collection Γ of all those coordinate subsets A ⊂ {1, . . . , n}
that can reconstruct the secret. The adversary structure of
the LSSS C ⊂ K × K n is the collection ∆ of all those
coordinate subsets B ⊂ {1, . . . , n} that can not reconstruct
the secret. Because of the linearity of C, reconstruction of the
secret from the coordinates in B is not unique if and only if
there exists a word in C that is zero on B for a nonzero secret.

Next, we deﬁne the t-th generation of C, denoted by C (t) ,
as follows: C (t) =< S1 , S2 , .., St >, where Si = {c1 · c2 ... ·
ci |where c1 , c2 ..., ci are different rows in G}. Thus, if j1 +j2 +
...+jm t, for ejs ∈ C (js ) , 1 s m, then ej1 ·ej2 ...·ejm ∈
C (t) . For example, if t = 6, then for any e1 , e2 , e3 ∈ C (2) ,
we have that e1 · e2 · e3 ∈ C (6) .
Our task is to choose k, i1 , i2 , ..., im such that every vector
in C (t) has even weight for some t.
Next, we take any different t(t i) rows c1 , c2 , ..., ct from
Ai , and we get the following vector c1 ·c2 ...·ct . There are k
t
(t)
such vectors. Then we deﬁne Ai to be the matrix consisting
(t)
of all these vectors. So Ai is a k by k matrix. Indeed

Proof: For the weight of the product of rows, assume
it is the multiplication of rows r1 , r2 , ..., rt . To count the
weight, for a certain column j, we have to make sure that
all r1 , r2 , ...rt have 1 in column j. Since we have listed all
weight i columns in the matrix Ai , we know that the total
number of choices for such kind of columns is k−t (this is
i−t
beacuse for the rest k − t positions, we can freely chose i − t
1s.)

For the proof we ﬁrst show that such a c1 ∈ C1 exists.
Since B ∈ ∆, there exists c∗ ∈ C1 that is zero on B. Since
c0 ∈ C0 ,

Let C be a code of length N = n + 1. Let C0 ⊂ C be
the subset of vectors in C with 0 in the secret position.
Let C1 ⊂ C be the coset with 1 in the secret position.
For a possibly corrupted list of shares c1 , . . . , cn , let

c1 ∈ C1 be such that for all c0 ∈ C0 ,

Ai is a k by
matrix such that the columns of Ai consist
of all different vectors of weight i and length k. Notice that
i
the weight of each row of Ai is k · k = k−1 . Under the
i−1
i
above construction, we have the result below:

For a strongly self-orthogonal code, the secret can be
reconstructed by any qualiﬁed subset A ∈ Γ in the presence
of an unknown active adversary B ∈ ∆. An active adversary
can change the values on his coordinates. We explain the
reconstruction procedure [2], [9]. On input n shares, possibly
corrupted on the subset B ∈ ∆, the procedure yields as
output the correct value s of the secret but in general without
information about the adversary B or about which shares
were corrupted.

u + t − 1, v + t − 1} , and this set has cardinality l − 1. It is
also obvious that j + l = k − t + 1. We also deﬁne a set of
vectors G = {ek ∈ Fk |1 r t − 1} .So it is obvious that
r
2
E ∪ F ∪ G gives us a basis for our desired vector space. Since
|E| = j, |F | = l − 1, |G| = t − 1 and E, F, G are mutually
disjoint, we have that |E ∪ F ∪ G| = j + l − 1 + t − 1 = k − 1.
So our proposition holds.

Proof: First, we need to show that each row is different. To show this, we consider two different sets of
rows. If r1 ·r2 ... · rt = r1 · r2 ...·rt , and by multiplying
i − t rows s1 , s2 , ..., si−t on both sides, we will get the
same answer. However, since {r1 , r2 , ...rt , s1 , s2 , ..., si−t } =
{r1 , r2 , ..., rt , s1 , s2 , ..., si−t }, we see that for any i rows
production, we would get a weight 1 vector of length k .
i
In addtion, for any i rows, there is only one unique column
such that all rows contain 1 at that column. So different i
rows will give different products. So it is a contradiction. So
(t)
the matrix Ai is a k × k matrix with different rows.
t
i
i
Next, we need to show the weight of the column is t .
This is obvious, because we take all the possible products of t
rows of the original matrix and so the weight of each column
(t)
i
is t . If two columns in Ai are the same, then we would
see that the corresponding two columns in Ai are the same,
(t)
contradiction. So the columns of the matrix Ai are different.
For the weight of the row, if the row is the product of rows
r1 , r2 , ..., rt , to count the weight, for a certain column j, we
have to make sure that all r1 , r2 , ...rt have 1 in column j and
since we have put all weight i columns in the matrix. We know
that the total choice for such kind of columns is k−t (this is
i−t
beacuse for the rest k − t positions, we can freely chose i − t
1s). Thus, we could check that the total number of 1s in the
i
matrix Ai is k k−t = k t , and this equation is indeed

Remark 5. The above theorem not only tells us that half
of the vectors in Fk give even weight vectors, but also tells
2
us how to ﬁnd a basis of such vector space. Thus, we have
characterized all the possible cases of vectors in Fk such that
2
for ﬁxed k, t, any row in G(t) has even weight.
Next, for ﬁxed value k, we wish to ﬁnd some vectors in
Fk such that those vectors would make the rows of G(t)
2
to be even for several choices of t at the same time. For
example, if k = 10, we may consider this problem: for what
choice of vectors in F10 , the rows of G(t) are all even for
2
t = 1, 2, 3, 4? Indeed, we could use an extension method to
work this out. Furthermore, we may believe that the cardinality
of S ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., k} may determine the number of choices
of v ∈ Fk . Indeed, we have the following result:
2
Theorem 6. If |S| = m, the vectors which makes any matrix
in GS := G(t) |t ∈ S have all even weight rows form a
vector space of dimension k−m, and so the number of choices
for v ∈ Fk is 2k−m .
2
Proof: The fact that vectors which make GS is a
vector space can be proved easily. Consider a set S =
{a1 , a2 , ..., am } ⊆ {1, 2, 3, ..., k}, with a1 > a2 > a3 >
... > am . From what we did above, for G(a1 ) to have all
even weight rows, we know that for the last k − a1 + 1
positions, we have that the dimension is k − a1 . So the
dimension of vector space which make G(a1 ) to have all even
weight rows is a1 + k − a1 + 1 = k − 1. Now consider the
a2 , a2 +1, ..., a1 −1 positions, if a vector makes G(a1 ) , G(a2 ) to
have all even weight rows, when the last k − a1 + 1 positions
are ﬁxed, the positions a2 , a3 , ..., a1 − 1 should rise to dimension a1 − a2 − 1(because half of the vectors with length
a1 − a2 − 1 give even weight and half odd weight). So for
G(a1 ) , G(a2 ) to all have even weight rows, the dimension is
k−a1 +(a1 −a2 −1)+a2 −1 = k−2. Similarly, we can repeat
this argument, for ﬁxed a2 , a2 + 1, ..., a1 , a1 + 1..., k positions,
consider the positions a3 , a3 + 1, ..., a2 − 1, half of them make
that G(a1 ) , G(a2 ) , G(a3 ) all have even weight rows. So the
dimension is k −a1 +(a1 −a2 −1)+(a2 −a3 −1)−(a3 −1) =
k − 3. Therefore, we can repeat this argument to see that the
dimension of the vector space is k − a1 + (a1 − a2 − 1) +
(a2 − a3 − 1) − ... − (am−1 − am − 1) + (am − 1) = k − m.
So the number of choices for v ∈ Fk is 2k−m .
2
In our construction, we are more interested in [n] =
{1, 2..., n} for n k. If each row in G(t) has even weight for
every t n, then for every t n, every vector in D(t) has
even weight and thus every vector in C (n) has even weight.
As is shown in the above results, for ﬁxed n k, since [n]
has cardinality n, the vector space U which makes C (n) have

(t)

Let G(t) = (Ai1 Ai2 ...Aim ) , where (Ai1 Ai2 ...Aim )
(t)
is deﬁned in a similar way as Ai . Let D(t) be the linear
code generated by the rows of G(t) . We consider a vector
v = (v1 , v2 , ..., vk ) ∈ Fk , and let As be in G if and only
2
if vs = 1. Vector v gives us information whether some
block Ai is chosen or not. For example, if k = 10 and
v = (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1), then G = [A1 A3 A6 A7 A9 A10 ] .
For ﬁxed k and t, we want to ﬁnd all the possible vectors
v ∈ Fk such that the weight of each row of G(t) is even.
2
Proposition 4. The set of v ∈ Fk such that each row of G(t)
2
has even weight is a subspace of Fk with dimension k − 1.
2
Proof: It is easy to show that the set is a vector
space. We know from the above theorem that the weight
(t)
of each row of Ai is k−t , consider the binomial coefﬁi−t
cients k−t , k−t , ..., k−t , if some k−t , k−t , ..., k−t

2
at position i + t − 1 in ek

Suppose in position t1 , t2 , ..., tl, (t < t1

all even weight vectors has dimension k − n. Let us give a
way to ﬁnd a basis for the vector space U.
First, we need to construct a matrix Mk , where the s − t
entry of Mk is mst = s−1 for s t, for s < t, mst = 0.
t−1
Here, we denote 0 = 1.We want to have a matrix Nk such
0
that Mk Nk = Ik , where Ik is the k by k identity matrix.
The ﬁrst column in matrix Nk denotes the choice for which
C (k−1) have all even weight codes but C (k) has some odd
weight vector. Similarly, the j th column in matrix Nk denotes
the choice for which C (k−j) have all even weight codes but
C (k−j+1) have some odd weights vectors.

For example, if k = 4, R(1, 4) is generated by the matrix

on the u rows.

When u > v, we see that muv is even, which is 0 modulo 2.
2
When u = v, we see that muv = 1. So Mk = Ikk.
Therefore, we have the following result:

wu =

Since the basis of U is clearly described by the above
theorem, we will need to study the behavior of Mk for certain
k. The ﬁrst column of Mk has period 1, the second and the
third columns have period 2. By Lucas’ Theorem, for n 1,
from the 2n−1 + 1 th column to 2n th column, the period is
2n . Then we have the following result:

Proof: Let us add u rows of Ai and get a vector, say
v = r1 + r2 + ... + ru = (v1 , v2 , ..., v(k) ). If vm = 1, then
i
{r1m , r2m , ..., rum } has odd number of 1s.
If {r1m , r2m , ..., rum } contains only one 1 and the rest are
0. There are u k−1 possible choices. So by this combi1 i−1
nation, u k−1 1s will appear in the vector v. Similarly,
1 i−1
if {r1m , r2m , ..., rum } contains three 1s and the rest are 0.
There are u k−1 such choices. Therefore, we could follow

Theorem 9. For a ﬁxed k 2l , for any vector v ∈ F2 , deﬁne
2
u ∈ Fk in the following way: u = (v, v, ..., v, v ), where v is
2
a punctured of v with the last several digits deleted to make
the length of u be k. Then u is a vector which makes the
l
vectors in C (k−2 ) be all even weight. Conversely, If for some
choice u ∈ Fk , every vector in C (t) has even weight. Assume
2
2l−1 k − t 2l , then this vector u is of the following form:
l
u = (v, v, ..., v, v ), where v ∈ F2 and v is a punctured of

and 0 i − 2j + 1 k − u. So the range of j is max(1, u +
1 + i − k) 2j min(i + 1, u + 1).
(1)
Since adding all rows in Ai will give either zero vector
or all 1 vector, thus, we have the following result:

Relation to Reed-Muller code
Let R(r, m) be the Reed Muller code deﬁned in a normal
way. Let Sr be the set which generates R(r, m). Thus, the
all one vector 1 ∈ Sr . Let Rr be the subcode of R(r, m)
which is generated by Sr \1. Therefore, no matter how we
choose blocks A1 , A2 , ..., Ak , we would always see that C (r)
is a punctured code of Rr . This is the reason why we call the
code we constructed as Reed-Muller type code.

Theorem 11. If C (1) is generated by one single block Ai , the
minimum distance of C (1) is min {wu |1 u k − 1}, where
wu is the weight of the codeword added by u rows.
For example, let k = 5, i = 3.. For the sum of n rows, the

weight w is the following

The following table gives the shortest possible codes obtained with our construction for which C (t) is an even weight
code.

For a ﬁxed k, suppose we want C (t) to have all even weight
codes. In matrix Mk , the ﬁrst k − t columns give us a basis of
the subspace U of Fk which makes C (t) have all even weight
2
codes. Our task is to pick up a vector u ∈ U such that the
length of the corresponding C (t) is as short as possible.
By using the above result, we could ﬁnd the minimum
distance of any C (1) very quickly. For example, for k = 7,
consider the sum of column 2 and column 3 in matrix
M7 , we get a generator matrix G = [A1 A2 A5 A6 ], and
C (1) , C (2) , C (3) , C (4) have all even weight codewords. The
length of the code is 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 56. To calculate

the minimum distance of C (1) , we list the sum of n rows for
1 n k. Let the weight of the sum of n rows be w.

Some useful codes

Blocks Ai

So the minimum distance is 4 here and the weight distribution
of our linear code is very clear. In addition, assume we add one
more block i = 2 here. For i = 2, if we sum one, two ,three,
four and ﬁve rows, we would get the weights of the resultant
vectors to be 4, 6, 6, 4, 0 resp. Therefore, if we combine A2
and A3 together, we would get the weights of the vectors to
be 10, 12, 10, 8, 10 resp.

t

= 4.

Hence, the minimum distance of C (1) is 24. By this method,
we have constructed a [56, 7, 24] code C (1) which satisﬁes the
property that C (1) , C (2) , C (3) , C (4) all have even weight.
Example 12. For k = 10, and for i1 = 3, i2 = 7, the code
C = C (1) has length 240. The generator matrix for C is
the 10 × 240 matrix with 10 = 120 columns of weight 3
3
and 10 = 120 columns of weight 7. The code C (i) is of
7
dimension 10, 45, 120, 195, 230, resp., for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The
codes C (i) and C (5−i) are dual codes for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
