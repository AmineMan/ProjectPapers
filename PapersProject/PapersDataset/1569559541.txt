of a power limit, the sensors could ideally collaborate with
all the other nodes, make the inference in the network, and
transmit the estimated parameter to the FC without any further
distortion (by using inﬁnite transmission power). However, in
the presence of a strict power constraint, both collaboration
and transmission have to be performed judiciously, so as to
maximize the quality of inference at the FC. In this paper, we
study the tradeoff between cumulative transmission power and
the quality of inference for a given collaborative neighborhood.
We assume cost-free collaboration, i.e., the power required to
share observations within the neighborhood is negligibly small
compared to the power required to communicate with the FC.
In an extended version of this paper, we would address the more
general problem where collaboration incurs a ﬁnite cost.
In the absence of collaboration, this problem is the same as
distributed estimation, which has been extensively researched both from analog [1],[4] and digital [5],[6] encoding perspectives. When the parameter to be estimated is a scalar, as in our
case, much of the problem formulation is similar to distributed
beamforming in relay networks [7],[8]. However, research regarding collaborative estimation is relatively nascent. When the
transmission channels are orthogonal and cost-free collaboration
is possible within a fully connected sensor network, it has
been shown in [3] that it is optimal to perform the inference
in the network and use the best available channel to transmit
the estimated parameter. In this paper, we study the optimal
collaboration design for the partially connected network and
coherent MAC channel.

Abstract—We consider a power-constrained sensor network,
consisting of multiple sensor nodes and a fusion center (FC),
that is deployed for the purpose of estimating a common random
parameter of interest. In contrast to the distributed framework, the
sensor nodes are allowed to update their individual observations
by (linearly) combining observations from neighboring nodes. The
updated observations are communicated to the FC using an analog
amplify-and-forward modulation scheme and through a coherent
multiple access channel. The optimal collaborative strategy is obtained by minimizing the cumulative transmission power subject to
a maximum distortion constraint. For the distributed scenario (i.e.,
with no observation sharing), the solution reduces to the powerallocation problem considered by Xiao et. al. [1]. Collaboration
among neighbors signiﬁcantly improves power efﬁciency of the
network in the low local-SNR regime, as demonstrated through an
insightful example and numerical simulations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Wireless sensor networks consist of spatially distributed
battery-powered sensors that monitor certain environmental conditions and often cooperate to perform speciﬁc signal processing
tasks like detection, estimation and classiﬁcation [2]. In this
paper, we consider a network that is deployed for the purpose
of estimating a common random parameter of interest. After
observing noisy versions of the parameter, the sensors can
share their observations among other neighboring nodes, an act
referred to as collaboration in this paper (following [3]). The
observations from all the neighbors are linearly combined and
then transmitted to the fusion center (FC) through a coherent
MAC channel. The FC receives the noise-corrupted signal and
makes the ﬁnal inference. The schematic diagram of such a
system is shown in Figure 1 (we will introduce the notations
and describe each block later in Section II).

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
We consider the scenario where the parameter of interest
is a scalar random variable with known statistics, speciﬁcally,
Gaussian distributed with zero mean and variance η 2 . The observations at the sensor nodes n = 1, 2, . . . , N are governed by the
linear model xn = hn θ + n , where hn is the source attenuation
and wn is the measurement noise. Let h = [h1 , h2 , . . . , hN ]T .
The measurement noise vector = [ 1 , 2 , . . . , N ]T is assumed
to be zero-mean, Gaussian with (spatial) covariance E[ T ] =
Σ. Perfect knowledge of the observation model parameters
{hn }N and Σ is assumed. In vector notation, the observation

where x = [x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ]T denotes the vector of observations.
We consider an extension of the analog amplify-and-forward
scheme as our encoding and modulation framework for communication to the fusion center. In the basic amplify-and-forward
scheme, each node transmits a weighted version of its own

observation, say Wn xn , with resulting power Wn E[x2 ]. Such

2) Optimal: For a memoryless Gaussian source transmitted
through an AWGN channel (Figure 1 with N = 1), an amplifyand-forward scheme helps achieve the optimal power-distortion
tradeoff in an information-theoretic sense (see Example 2.2 in
[9]). The optimality of linear coding has also been established
[10] for distributed estimation over a coherent MAC (Figure
1 without spatial collaboration) when the observation noise is
spatially uncorrelated.
Let the availability of collaborative links among the various
nodes be represented by the N × N adjacency matrix (not
necessarily symmetric) A, where Aij ∈ {0, 1}. An entry
Aij = 1 signiﬁes that node j shares its observations with
node i. Sharing of this observation is assumed to be realized
through a reliable communication link that consumes power
Ci,j , regardless of the actual value of observation. The N × N
matrix C describes all the costs of collaboration among various
sensors and is assumed to be known. Since each node is trivially
connected to itself, Aii = 1 and Cii = 0. We denote the set of
all A-sparse matrices as

The transformed observations z are assumed to be transmitted
to the fusion center through a coherent-MAC channel. In practice, a coherent MAC channel can be realized through transmit
beamforming [11], where sensor nodes simultaneously transmit
a common message (in our case, all zk -s are scaled versions of a
common θ) and the phases of their transmissions are controlled
so that the signals constructively combine at the FC. The channel
gain at node n is assumed to be gn and the noise of the coherentMAC channel u is assumed to be a zero-mean AWGN with
variance ξ 2 . Perfect knowledge of the channel state {gn }N

where P denotes the (cumulative) power available in the network. It should be noted that, in addition to a cumulative
power constraint, there may be individual power constraints
corresponding to the various sensor nodes. However, we do not
address the individual power constraints in this paper and this
issue remains a worthy topic for future research.
Problem (10), in general, has no known globally optimal
solution. However, for the special case when the entries of
the collaboration cost matrix C are either zero or inﬁnity,
Cij ∈ {0, ∞}, we will show that there exists a unique solution
for which a closed-form solution can be derived. Physically,
this special case corresponds to the situation when the topology of a network is ﬁxed (and hence not subject to design)
and communication among neighbors are relatively inexpensive
compared to communication with the FC. Let A = zero(C)
denote the permitted adjacency matrix for such a situation.
Hence, the collaboration cost vanishes, QA = 0, and problem

The design of the the collaboration matrix W is critical
since it affects both the power requirements and estimation
performance of the entire application. Speciﬁcally, the following
quantities depend on W , 1) the resources required to collaborate, Qnz(W ) 1 , as described in (4), 2) the resources required to
transmit, PW , as described in (5) and 3) the ﬁnal distortion of
the estimate at the FC, DW , provided by (8). In this paper,
we address the problem of designing the optimum collaboration
matrix subject to a (cumulative) power constraint,

We would refer to W as the collaboration matrix. It may be
noted that, 1) Particularization: When W is a diagonal matrix
(equivalently, A is the identity matrix I N ), our collaborative
scheme simpliﬁes to the basic amplify-and-forward strategy [1],
2) Collaboration cost: Any collaboration involving W ∈ SA is
achieved at the expense of (cumulative) power

general case (problem (10) for arbitrary costs C and the topology being subject to design), one can start from the distributed
topology A = I, and follow a greedy algorithm and augment
the collaborative topology with the most power-efﬁcient link at
each iteration. This extension is not discussed in this paper due
to space constraints and will be relegated to an extended version
of this paper.

Furthermore, distortion resulting from (20) is information theoretically optimal.
Proof: See [13]. Information theoretic optimality follows
from Corollary 2.3.5 of [14].
The information theoretic optimality is expected since a fully
connected network is equivalent to the centralized scenario with
effective channel gain g .
Remark 2 (Limits and a lower bound): For better understanding the dependence of distortion D on (cumulative) SNR Pξ , we
compute the low and high SNR limits of distortion (and optimal
weights, upto second order Taylor series) in Table I. For any
topology A (and consequently Γ), provided a large (cumulative)
power is available, the resultant distortion approaches that of
the centralized case, D0 (see (9)). In low-SNR situations, the
distortion approaches that of the prior, η 2 . Towards the goal of
obtaining a simpler approximation of (17) for both the low and
high SNR regimes, we obtain the following result.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we addressed the problem of collaborative
estimation in a sensor network where sensors communicate with
the FC using a coherent MAC channel. For the scenario when
the collaborative topology is ﬁxed and collaboration is cost-free,
we obtained the optimal power-distortion tradeoff in closed-form
by solving a QCQP problem. Through the use of both theoretical
and numerical results, we established that collaboration helps
to substantially lower the power requirements in a network,
specially in low local-SNR scenario. As future work, we wish to
explore the collaborative estimation problem when the parameter
to be estimated is a vector with correlated elements. The issue of
collaboration with non-zero cost, as mentioned earlier, is also
important. Finally, collaboration in the presence of individual
power constraints (in addition to cumulative) is another topic
worthy of future research.

When local-SNR is large, say γ = 100, then even a fully
connected network can provide only a power saving of 1%.
On the other hand, if the local-SNR is small, say γ = 1, then a
fully connected network can provide upto 50% power savings.

IV. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
To demonstrate the (cumulative) power saved due to collaboration and to investigate whether the insights obtained
from Proposition 4 extend to more complicated scenarios, we
consider the following simulation setup. The spatial placement
and neighborhood structure is modeled as a Random Geometric Graph, RGG(N, r) [16], where sensors are uniformly
distributed over a unit square with bidirectional communication
links present only for pairwise distances at most r, i.e., A such
that Ai,j = 1 [di,j ≤r] .The noise is modeled as a homogeneous
I
and exponentially correlated Gaussian covariance matrix, i.e., Σ
is such that Σi,j = σ 2 ρdi,j , where ρ ∈ (0, 1) is indicative of
the degree of spatial correlation. A smaller value of ρ indicates
lower correlation with ρ → 0 signifying completely independent
observations. Speciﬁcally, we consider ρ = 10−3 and ρ = 10−7
to contrast the effect of correlation (for sensor nodes apart by
distance di,j = 0.1, the actual correlations are ρ0.1 ≈ 0.5
and ρ0.1 ≈ 0.2 respectively). We consider N = 50 nodes
with identical local-SNR (speciﬁcally, σ 2 = 0.5, h = 1 with
η 2 = 1 and η 2 = 2 for two separate runs). The individual
channel gains were generated by uniform random numbers in the
range (0, 1]. At each instance, power was allocated to satisfy the
2
pre-speciﬁed distortion performance of η +D0 . We display the
2
power savings obtained after collaborating through RGG(N, r)
(0)
(r)
topology, Popt − Popt , as a percentage of the power required for
(0)
the distributed case, Popt , for increasing radius of collaboration
r, in Figure 5. We note that signiﬁcant power is saved through
collaboration for different magnitudes of local-SNR, η 2 , and
varying degrees of spatial correlation, ρ. Also, we observe that
