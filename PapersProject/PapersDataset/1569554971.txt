Abstract—In this paper, we focus on a general coordinated
multi-point (CoMP) multiple input multiple-output (MIMO) system consisting of multiple users and multiple base stations (BSs)
equipped with multiple antennas, respectively. An asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression and the capacity-achieving
input covariance matrices for the system are derived employing
novel techniques from large dimensional random matrix theory
(RMT). The asymptotic regime is based on the assumption that
the numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver approach
to inﬁnity with a ﬁxed ratio. Our contributions are to extend the
previous results to the general channel model with two-sided
spatial correlation and line-of-sight (LOS), in which the transmit
and receive correlation matrices are both generally nonnegative
deﬁnite and the channel entries are non-Gaussian distributed.
Simulations show that the asymptotic capacity is accurate even
for ﬁnite number of antenna and invariant to all types of fading
distribution.

statistical independent random matrices have independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries (not necessary Gaussian).
¯
Using Hl,k denotes deterministic matrix which reﬂect LOS
components of the channel, and Rl,k and Tl,k denote deterministic nonnegative deﬁnite matrices which, respectively,
characterizing the spatial correlation structure at the receiver
and transmitter sides separatively. There have been a few
results on MIMO capacity analysis utilizing large dimensional
RMT [3], [5]–[9], however, the general model studied in this
paper has not been considered.
To appreciate the generality of our result, we then introduce
the related work. Based on the Stieltjes transform method (or
the Silverstein-Bai method) [13], a deterministic equivalent to
the mutual information was derived in [5] for non-Gaussian
channel of the case with K = L = 1. These results were
partially generalized to the case that K ≥ 1 and Rl,k ’s were
¯
permitted to be nonnegative deﬁnite, while Hl,k = 0 and
Tl,k ’s are still required to be diagonal in [9]. Clearly, the
results of [5] and [9] cannot allow UEs to be equipped with
multiple spatially correlated antennas. Using Gaussian tools,
Hachem et al. [6] obtained the asymptotic mutual information
expressions of Rayleigh fading channels when K = L = 1, in
the sense that Rl,k ’s and Tl,k ’s are not necessarily diagonal.
More recently, Dumont et al. [8] generalized this result to
Rician fading channels. However, if the results in [6], [8] are
applied directly to the case with K ≥ 1 and L ≥ 1, it requires
that T1,k , . . . , TL,k are simultaneously unitary diagonalizable
for every k.
In this paper, we aim to obtain the deterministic equivalents (e.g., the Stieltjes transform and the ergodic mutual
information) of the CoMP-MIMO channel when the statistical
independent random matrices are Gaussian distributed using
the Gaussian tools. Our results are much more general and can
be used to cope with more complex applications. Using the
generalized Lindeberg principle [14], we then generalize the
deterministic equivalents of the considered random matrices
with Gaussian entries to those with non-Gaussian entries.
Then, we obtain the asymptotic optimal input covariance
by a standard waterﬁlling procedure. Simulations show that
the asymptotic capacity is invariant to all types of fading
distribution.

I. I NTRODUCTION
With the developments in wireless communication technologies, the digital devices that be constantly upgraded make our
life become more and more convenient. To obtain higher data
rates, the academia and the industry have put great effort
to improve the spectral efﬁciency and data throughput of
wireless communication systems. However, in many cases, the
achievable cell spectral efﬁciency is limited by the inter-cell
interference. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in
coordinated multi-point transmission/reception (CoMP), which
can substantially mitigate interference and improve the celledge user service quality [1], [2]. This is motivated by that
the base stations (BSs) jointly process their signals for a
user equipment (UE) by exchanging user data and/or channel
state information (CSI) via high-speed backhaul links. Such
BS cooperation in particular leads to enormous throughput
gains as compared to the single-cell processing where the
interference (often from other cells) is treated as noise.
In recent years, large dimensional random matrix theory
(RMT) [3]–[12] as an effective tool is widely used to circumvent various problems in wireless communications. In
this paper, we investigate multi-BS cooperative uplink MIMO
transmission systems consisting of K UEs and L BSs, respectively, equipped with multiple antennas. The channel between
UE k and BS l is modeled as the general channel with twosided spatial correlation and line-of-sight (LOS), where the

We consider a CoMP MIMO uplink system with L BSs, labeled as BS1 , . . . , BSL , which are equipped with N1 , . . . , NL
antennas respectively, and K UEs, labeled as UE1 , . . . , UEK ,
which are equipped with n1 , . . . , nK antennas respectively. All
BSs can cooperate to jointly process user signals via highspeed backhaul links. In this paper, we use the Kronecker
model to characterize the spatial correlation of the MIMO
channel for each link so that the correlation at a BS and a
UE is modeled separately [15]. Speciﬁcally, the channel from
UEk to BSl , Hl,k ∈ CNl ×nk , can be written as

The channel Hk represents the joint channel between UE k

Speciﬁcally, VBN (σ 2 ) provides a performance metric regarding the number of bits per second per Hertz per antenna

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the ergodic
capacity of the interested channel in the asymptotic regime
where L, K are ﬁxed and N1 , · · · , NL , n1 , . . . , nK all grow

For convenience, we refer to this asymptotic regime simply
as N → ∞ in the sequel. Toward this end, using the
Shannon transform, we ﬁnd VN (σ 2 ) so that E{VBN (σ 2 )} −
VN (σ 2 ) → 0. In general, the computation of E{VBN (σ 2 )}
relies on time-consuming Monte-Carlo computer simulations,
while the deterministic equivalent is a lot easier to compute
than E{VBN (σ 2 )}. Finally, we use VN (σ 2 ) to obtain the
asymptotic optimal input covariance matrices that maximize
the ergodic mutual information.

To get strict mathematical result, we ﬁrst state the assumptions imposed in the system model.

Xij ’s are i.i.d. complex random variables with independent
real and imaginary parts such that

It is noted that κl,k and Pl,k are independent from the
matrix dimensions. Therefore, the normalization is valid for
all possible correlation patterns and thus does not impose any
restriction on practical applications. In addition, the setting
implies that the LOS components of some link pairs are
allowed to be absent.

Remark 1: Theorem 1 is developed under the asymptotic
regime where L, K are ﬁxed and {Nl , nk }’s all grow to
inﬁnity with ﬁxed ratios. For other applications, we would
be interested in the cases with ﬁxed {Nl , nk }’s while L and
K grow to inﬁnity. In this case, the entries of Xl,k ’s shall be

normalized by n rather than nk . Under this setting, the
developed theorems are much more general than the result by
Hachem et al. in [6, Theorem 2.5] in the sense that Rl,k ’s and
Tl,k ’s are not necessarily diagonal.
Using Theorem 1, we then derive a deterministic equivalent
of the ergodic mutual information in the following theorem.

Let BN be an N × N matrix obtained from BN in

It is well known that the ergodic capacity of the MIMO
channel is achieved by selecting a proper covariance matrix
of input signal [17], [18]. Let Qk be the input covariance
matrix of UEk and satisﬁes tr(Qk ) ≤ nk . Deﬁne Q
diag (Q1 , . . . , QK ). Then, the ergodic sum capacity of the
CoMP-MIMO channel can be expressed as

It is well known that the optimization problem (22) can be
solved by a standard waterﬁlling procedure. Thus, we get the
next proposition
Proposition 1: Let Pk = VPk ΛPk UHk . For each ﬁxed

of WR,ij include the Rayleigh, Nakagami, and log-normal
distributions [20].
Fig. 1 shows the results of E VBN (σ 2 ) and VN (σ 2 ) for
K = 2 and L = 2 under different fading distributions.
Recall that our derivation is based on the assumption that Nl ’s
and nk ’s all grow to inﬁnity. However, we see that VN (σ 2 )
produces very good estimates for E VBN (σ 2 ) even when
only a few antenna elements (e.g., N1 = N2 = n1 = n2 = 2)
are located at each UE and antenna set. As expected, when the
number of antennas grows large (e.g., N1 = N2 = n1 = n2 =
8) all curves tend to overlap regardless of the distributions.
Thus, the ergodic mutual information in the large-system limit
is distributed invariance.
Finally, we clarify if the input covariance design based on
the deterministic equivalent results is robust. For the asymptotic optimization (21), the iterative alternative algorithm based
on the deterministic equivalent results is used. On the other
hand, the ﬁnite-size optimization problem (19) is solved by
the Vu-Paulraj algorithm [18]. The Vu-Paulraj algorithm is, in
fact, based on the barrier method where the average mutual
information and their ﬁrst and second derivatives are calculated
by Monte-Carlo methods with 104 trials. Note that in contrast
to the ﬁnite-size optimization, the asymptotic optimization

We notice the fact that VN (σ 2 , Q1 , . . . , QK ) is strict concavity with respect to Q, and E{VBN (σ 2 , Q◦ , . . . , Q◦ )} −

and (21), respectively.
Employing the concave optimal method and the KarushKuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, the optimization problem (21)
is equivalent to the following problem

IV. N UMERICAL RESULTS
First, we compare the analytical result VN (σ 2 ) (16) with
the Monte-Carlo simulation results of the ergodic mutual
information E VBN (σ 2 ) obtained from averaging over a
large number of independent realizations of H. The used
simulation settings are based on the following assumptions.
First, the spatial correlation and LOS are generated from an

(l,k)

are the amplitude fading drawn from a distribution with

where (a)+ = max{0, a} and μk is chosen to satisfy the
power constraints tr(Qk ) = nk .

Now, let VN (σ 2 , Q1 , . . . , QK ) be that obtained from VN (σ 2 )
¯
with Tl,k and Hl,k following the above replacements. Using
this large-systems results, the maximization problem (19) can
be replaced by
Qk ∈Qk ,∀k

(27)

and the eigenvalues are given by

where Qk
{Qk |tr(Qk ) ≤ nk and Qk 0} is the feasible
set of Qk . The optimization problem (19) is convex and
can be solved using stochastic programming based on convex
optimization in combination with Monte-Carlo method [19].
However, the main drawback is long execution time for exhaustive averaging. We thus propose asymptotic programming
based on the large-system results in Theorem 2.
Because the large-system results are invariant to the type
of fading distribution, any designs based on the large-system
results are invariant and thus robust. Therefore, the properties
of the asymptotic optimal input covariance are invariant to the
type of fading distribution. The effect of Qk can be simply
involved into VN (σ 2 ) by the following replacements:

2, we evaluate E VBN (σ 2 , Q1 , . . . , QK )} when the input
covariance matrices are obtained using the deterministic equivalent results and the Vu-Paulraj algorithm. As we can see,
the asymptotic approach provides indistinguishable results to
the Vu-Paulraj algorithm. However, the asymptotic approach
enjoys a much lower complexity since no lengthy Monte-Carlo
procedures are needed.
V. C ONCLUSION
This paper addressed the general CoMP MIMO channel
model with spatial correlation and LOS where the correlation
matrices are generally nonnegative deﬁnite and the channel
entries are non-Gaussian distributed. Using large dimensional
RMT, the asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression
and the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices this system were proposed. We showed that the asymptotic capacity
is invariant to all types of fading distribution.
