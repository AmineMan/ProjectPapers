though the channel studied in this paper has a more restrictive
interference proﬁle than that in [9], we address the more
general discrete memoryless channel and provide more general
classes of common strategies as well as capacity regions under
some conditions. Speciﬁcally, we derive an achievable rate
region R based on rate splitting, superposition coding and
binning at the broadcast transmitter and rate splitting at the interfering transmitter. This region is a natural generalization of
Marton’s region [1] for a DM-BC. We then deﬁne two partial
order broadcast conditions, interference-oblivious less noisy
and interference-cognizant less noisy. Under these conditions,
a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent to the region
based on a simpler scheme that uses only superposition coding
at the broadcast transmitter. Furthermore, if interference is
strong for the interference-oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, the
capacity region is given by the aforementioned two equivalent
rate regions. Interestingly, for the interference-cognizant less
noisy DM-BIC, we argue that the strong but not very strong
interference condition does not exist and in this case, we obtain
the capacity region for the very strong interference.
This paper is organized as the follows. The channel model
is introduced in Section II, followed by the derivation of R in
Section III. For the DM-BIC with two partial order broadcast
conditions, the equivalence of rate regions is presented in
Section IV and the capacity regions are derived in Section
V. This paper is concluded in Section VI.

the proofs, otherwise stated, are relegated to the full version

Abstract—We study a class of discrete memoryless broadcast
interference channels (DM-BICs), where one of the broadcast
receivers is subject to the interference from a point-to-point
transmission. A general achievable rate region R based on
rate splitting, superposition coding and binning at the broadcast transmitter and rate splitting at the interfering transmitter is derived. Under two partial order broadcast conditions
interference-oblivious less noisy and interference-cognizant less
noisy, a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent to the
region based on a simpler scheme that uses only superposition
coding at the broadcast transmitter. Furthermore, the capacity
regions of a DM-BIC under the two partial order broadcast
conditions are characterized respectively for the strong and very
strong interference conditions.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Broadcast channel and interference channel are two important classes of multi-user channels that have drawn considerable research attention in the past few decades, mostly due
to their simplicity as a fundamental building block and their
close relevance to practical communication networks. While
complete characterizations are not available, there have been
signiﬁcant advances on these topics in the information theory
literature. Notably the best general achievable schemes for the
two channels are respectively given by Marton [1] and HanKobayashi [2], which are capacity achieving for some subclass
channels or under various conditions, such as the ones in [3][6].
Motivated by a recent interest in a heterogeneous cellular
network design paradigm [7], we explore a multi-user channel
that combines the broadcasting and interference features, i.e.
broadcast interference channel (BIC). Speciﬁcally we envision
a communication scenario where a macro base station (BS)
broadcasts to two macro users, one of which is interfered by a
point-to-point transmission from a femto BS to a femto user.
While the BIC studied presents a simpliﬁed version of what
might happen in practice, we believe that a fundamental understanding of this simpler channel is crucial for characterizing
the trade-offs in heterogeneous networks.
Variations of BIC have been previously studied by Shang
and Poor in [8], for a different interference proﬁle where
interference is from the broadcast transmitter to the point-topoint receiver, and in [9], for the Gaussian BIC where both
of the broadcast receivers are subject to interference. Even

II. C HANNEL M ODEL
A discrete memoryless broadcast interference channel is
denoted by (X1 × X2 , p(y1 , y2 , y3 |x1 , x2 ), Y1 × Y2 × Y3 ),
where Xi , i = 1, 2, are the input alphabets, Yj , j = 1, 2, 3,
are the output alphabets and p(y1 , y2 , y3 |x1 , x2 ) is the channel transition probability. In this paper, we concentrate on
a speciﬁc interference proﬁle, where p(y1 , y2 , y3 |x1 , x2 ) =
p(y1 |x1 )p(y2 |x1 , x2 )p(y3 |x2 ). As shown in Fig 1, while transmitter 1 wishes to broadcast to receivers 1, 2 , the second
receiver is interfered by transmitter 2 who wishes to communicate with receiver 3.
Deﬁnition 1: A (M1 , M2 , M3 , n) code consists of message
sets Wj = {1, ..., Mj }; two encoding functions X1 : (W1 ×

and Y2 . The private message carriers V1 , V2 , which are only
decoded at their respective intended receivers and treated as
noise elsewhere, are superimposed upon U1 , where binning is
used to allow arbitrary dependence between V1 and V2 . At the
interfering transmitter, rate splitting is employed to alleviate
interference by receiver 2 decoding the common signal U2
while treating the private as noise.
Remark 1: Constraint (4) on the choice of joint input
distributions is a direct consequence of the nonnegativity of
some intermediate rates, which are eventually eliminated using
Fourier-Motzkin procedure.
Remark 2: With U1 = V1 = φ, X1 = V2 and R1 = 0, R
reduces to the compact Han-Kobayashi region [13] for a onesided interference channel. With X2 = U2 = φ and R3 = 0,
R reduces to the most general form of Marton’s region with
private message sets for a general DM-BC [11]. Notice that
with U2 = φ, the constraint (4) reduces to

The messages Wj are uniformly from Wj . The average error
probability for the (M1 , M2 , M3 , n) code is

Pe = Pr(g1 (Y1n ) = W1 or g2 (Y2n ) = W2 or g3 (Y3n ) = W3 ).
Deﬁnition 2: Rates of a (M1 , M2 , M3 , n) code are deﬁned
log (M )
as Rj = 2n j for j = 1, 2, 3.
Rates (R1 , R2 , R3 ) are said to be achievable if there exists a
sequence of (M1 , M2 , M3 , n) codes with Pe → 0 as n → ∞.
An achievable rate region is the set of all achievable rates for
a given coding scheme. The capacity region is the closure of
the union of all achievable rate regions.

which applies to Marton’s region. However a closer examination reveals that (5) is unnecessary. For some joint
distribution that violates (5), we have R1 , R2 ≤ I, where
I = min{I(U1 ; Y1 ), I(U1 ; Y2 )}. Clearly (R1 , R2 ) is contained
in Marton’s region for some other joint distribution that
satisﬁes (5). Therefore removing constraint (5) does not really
enlarge the region.

III. ACHIEVABLE R ATE R EGION FOR A G ENERAL DM-BIC
In this section, we derive an achievable rate region for a
general DM-BIC, where the broadcast transmitter employs rate
splitting, superposition coding and binning and the interfering
transmitter employs rate splitting.

IV. E QUIVALENCE OF R ATE R EGIONS FOR THE DM-BIC
UNDER PARTIAL O RDER B ROADCAST C ONDITIONS
Here we concentrate on the DM-BIC under two partial
order broadcast conditions: interference-oblivious less noisy
and interference-cognizant less noisy, which will be deﬁned
next.
Deﬁnition 3: In a DM-BIC, receiver 2 is said to be
interference-oblivious less noisy than receiver 1, denoted by
Y1 ≺o Y2 , if I(U1 ; Y1 ) ≤ I(U1 ; Y2 ) for all p(u1 , x1 )p(x2 )
such that U1 → (X1 , X2 ) → (Y1 , Y2 ).
Deﬁnition 4: In a DM-BIC, receiver 1 is said to be
interference-cognizant less noisy than receiver 2, denoted by
Y1 ≻c Y2 , if I(U1 ; Y1 ) ≥ I(U1 ; Y2 |X2 ) for all p(u1 , x1 )p(x2 )
such that U1 → (X1 , X2 ) → (Y1 , Y2 ).
Remark 3: We can interpret Y1 ≺o Y2 as the follows:
receiver 2 is less noisy than receiver 1 [4], even though no
particular action is taken by receiver 2 to deal with interference. Similarly, Y1 ≻c Y2 can be interpreted as the follows:
even if interference X2 is provided to receiver 2, receiver
1 is still less noisy. Also note that degradedness (physical
or stochastic, which are the same in broadcast channel [12,
Theorem 15.6.1]) implies the partial order conditions and
hence is stricter. For example, Y2 being degraded with respect
to Y1 , i.e. X1 → Y1 → Y2 holds for all p(x1 , x2 ), implies
Y1 ≻c Y2 , but not vice versa.
The ﬁrst class of schemes we consider is a specialization
of R, given in the following two corollaries.

such that
I(V1 ; Y1 |U1 , Q) + I(V2 ; Y2 |U1 , U2 , Q) − I(V1 ; V2 |U1 , Q) ≥ 0.

Proof: The detailed proof is relegated to [10]. Here we
provide a sketch. The messages for receivers 1, 2 are split into
common and private parts respectively. Common messages are
carried by the cloud signal U1 , which is decoded at both Y1

kept intact. While both Ri and R(i) rely on superposition
coding, there is a subtle difference. Despite the fact that both
schemes’ cloud centers carry receiver i’s message, the one
for Ri could also carry receiver j’s (j = i, j = 1, 2) common
message, which could be potentially helpful to reduce the selfinterference due to the fact that part of the broadcast signal
intended for receiver j is essentially interference from receiver
i’s perspective. It is apparent that the superposition-only-based
rate regions are not larger than the ones based on superposition
and rate splitting, since the latter includes the former as a
special case. This can be also veriﬁed by explicitly checking
that the inequalities deﬁning R(i) induce those in Ri , but not
vice versa. Hence at ﬁrst sight it seems that Ri is strictly larger
than R(i) . However, if we consider the no interference case,
i.e. U2 = X2 = φ, R3 = 0, Ri cannot be strictly larger than
R(i) since the latter is the capacity region of a less noisy (or
degraded) DM-BC [11]. The pitfall of the previous argument is
that it only considers a speciﬁc input distribution. It is true that
for some given PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 , Ri is strictly larger, however
once we consider all PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 , we will show that they
are indeed equivalent.
Theorem 4: Ri = R(i) , i = 1, 2.

with Y1 ≻c Y2 , where R2 is the closure of all (R1 , R2 , R3 )
satisfying

for some PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 = p(u1 )p(x1 |u1 )p(u2 )p(x2 |u2 ).
Remark 4: Fixing time-sharing r.v. Q = φ, Ri , i = 1, 2,
are obtained by specializing R with X1 = V2 , V1 = U1 , and
with X1 = V1 , V2 = U1 , respectively. It can be shown that
time-sharing does not enlarge Ri . Consequently, convex hull
operation is also unnecessary.
Next we present two achievable rate regions, R(i) , i = 1, 2,
which are solely based on superposition coding (i.e. no rate
splitting at the broadcast transmitter), where the cloud center
carries only receiver i’s message. Since the proofs are standard, they are omitted for conciseness.

with Y1 ≺o Y2 , where R(1) is the closure of all (R1 , R2 , R3 )
satisfying

A. Proof of Theorem 4
To illustrate the idea, here we only prove R2 = R(2) . The
proof of R1 = R(1) is similar but technically more involved
and is left to [10]. Before proving Theorem 4, we need the
following deﬁnitions and lemmas.
Deﬁnition 5: Let Rn be a convex subset of Rn , a nc
dimensional Euclidean space. A point X ∈ Rn is an extreme
c
point (ExP) iff whenever X = tY + (1 − t)Z, t ∈ (0, 1) and
Y = Z, this implies either Y ∈ Rn or Z ∈ Rn .
c
c
Deﬁnition 6: An ExP X ∈ Rn is said to be dominant
c
(DExP) iff there does not exist another ExP Y ∈ Rn , Y = X,
c
such that X ≤ Y element-wise.
Remark 5: In the literature, the term “dominant extreme
points” are sometimes referred as corner points. The intention
of choosing the former terminology is to emphasize the
connection to convex set.
Let Rn be a n-dimensional convex rate region, of which the
set of all DExPs is denoted by Ω. Further let co(Ω) denote
the convex hull of Ω:

≤ I(U1 ; Y1 )
≤ I(X1 ; Y2 |U1 , U2 )
≤ I(X2 ; Y3 )
≤ I(X1 , U2 ; Y2 |U1 ) + I(X2 ; Y3 |U2 )
≥0

for some PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 = p(u1 )p(x1 |u1 )p(u2 )p(x2 |u2 ).
Theorem 3: R(2) is an achievable rate region for a DM-BIC
with Y1 ≻c Y2 , where R(2) is the closure of all (R1 , R2 , R3 )
satisfying

Lemma 1: R ∈ Rn iff there exists some R′ ∈ co(Ω) such
that R ≤ R′ element-wise.
Lemma 1 suggests that a rate region is completely described
by its DExPs. When comparing different rate regions, it
sufﬁces to consider their sets of DExPs, which will be given
in the follows for R2 and R(2) .
Lemma 2: For a PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 , DExPs of R2 are given by:

for some PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 = p(u1 )p(x1 |u1 )p(u2 )p(x2 |u2 ).
In deriving the most general region R, we used rate
splitting, superposition coding and binning at the broadcast
transmitter. Regions Ri , i = 1, 2, are derived from R when
binning is stripped off but rate splitting and superposition

be decodable at receiver 2 (otherwise, none of the broadcast
receivers can do so). Hence the strong condition, originated
I(X2 ; Y3 |U2 ) + min{I(U2 ; Y3 ), I(U1 , U2 ; Y2 )}
from interference channel, naturally carries over to a DM-BIC
I(X1 ; Y1 |U1 ) + min{I(U1 ; Y2 |U2 ), [I(U1 , U2 ; Y2 ) − I(U2 ; Y3 )]+ }, with Y1 ≺o Y2 . However, this is not the case for a DM-BIC
with Y1 ≻c Y2 , which will be discussed next.

Lemma 3: For a PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 , R(2) has two DExPs A, B
as in Lemma 2.
Proof of Theorem 4: Let P = PU1 ,X1 ,U2 ,X2 and
PUi =φ denote the same distribution except Ui = φ. From
Lemma 2 and 3, for a given P, R2 has two more DExPs
than R(2) . However, for PU1 =U2 =φ , A becomes A′ =
( I(X1 ; Y1 ), 0, I(X2 ; Y3 ) ) and it can be shown C, D ≤ A′
due to Y1 ≻c Y2 . Therefore if we take the union of regions
for the two distributions P and PU1 =U2 =φ , both R2 and R(2)
will have identical DExPs. By Lemma 1, R2 = R(2) .

for some PU1 ,X1 ,X2 = p(u1 )p(x1 |u1 )p(x2 ).
Proof: The achievability follows those for R(2) and R2 ,
all with with U2 = X2 . The converse proof is standard.
Remark 8: Similarly to Theorem 5, the capacity region
takes two forms, one given in Theorem 6, which is essentially
R(2) with U2 = X2 , and another given by R2 with U2 = X2 .
It is not difﬁcult to see that strong condition in Deﬁnition
7 does not ﬁt well for a DM-BIC with Y1 ≻c Y2 . The reason
is that if X1 is the intended signal for receiver 2, i.e. if X1 is
always decodable at receiver 2, then by Y1 ≻c Y2 , receiver 1
can decode it as well. Hence the two receivers will always
decode the same set of messages, which clearly does not
represent the most general case. In fact, we claim that the
strong but not very strong interference condition does not exist
for a DM-BIC with Y1 ≻c Y2 . The argument is as the follows.
The problem is to ﬁgure out what is the intended signal for
receiver 2. Once we ﬁnd out such a signal, we can mimic
the strong condition in Deﬁnition 7, with modiﬁcation of
conditioning on that signal instead of X1 . Suppose there exists
some strong condition, then interference X2 is required to be
decoded at receiver 2. Under this restriction, we have an upper
bound n(R2 + R3 − ǫn ) ≤ I(W2 , W3 ; Y2n ). Along with other
straightforward upper bounds, by the same technique that we
used above to prove Theorem 5, we can show that R(2) with
U2 = X2 is the capacity region. This implies that if there exists
some strong condition, then superposition coding with cloud
center U1 carrying receiver 2’s message is capacity achieving.
Hence without loss of generality, we can view the cloud center
U1 as the intended signal for receiver 2, which in return gives
us the strong condition I(X2 ; Y2 |U1 ) ≥ I(X2 ; Y3 ), for all
p(u1 )p(x1 |u1 )p(x2 ) such that U1 → (X1 , X2 ) → (Y2 , Y3 )
form a Markov chain. However, this condition always implies
the very strong condition (consider U1 = φ) and furthermore
the strong interference capacity region, R(2) with U2 = X2 ,
always reduces to the very strong capacity region given in
Theorem 6. In other words for Y1 ≻c Y2 , if interference is
strong, then it has to be very strong.

V. C APACITY R EGIONS UNDER THE S TRONG /V ERY
S TRONG I NTERFERENCE C ONDITION
In this section, capacity regions of a DM-BIC with Y1 ≺o Y2
and Y1 ≻c Y2 are established respectively for the strong and
very strong interference conditions deﬁned in the following.
Deﬁnition 7: Interference is said to be strong if for all
p(x1 )p(x2 ), I(X2 ; Y2 |X1 ) ≥ I(X2 ; Y3 ).
Deﬁnition 8: Interference is said to be very strong if for all
p(x1 )p(x2 ), I(X2 ; Y2 ) ≥ I(X2 ; Y3 ).
Remark 6: The intuition behind these deﬁnitions, which are
the same as the regular interference channel [14], is that by
conditioning on the intended signal, whose decoding is assured
to be successful by design, the interfered receiver sees a better
channel than interference’s own receiver. This suggests that the
interfered receiver should be able to decode the interference
along with its intended signal, by performing a joint decoding
if interference is strong. If further interference is very strong,
successive interference cancellation decoding sufﬁces, where
interference is decoded ﬁrst. Evidently very strong condition
is stricter than the strong condition.

Y2 and the strong interference condition is the closure of all
(R1 , R2 , R3 ) satisfying

The one given in Theorem 5 is identical to R(1) with U2 = X2 .
An alternative form is given by R1 with U2 = X2 .
When receiver 2 is interference-oblivious less noisy than
receiver 1, for any sensible coding scheme X1 should always

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we devise a coding scheme combining rate
splitting, superposition coding and binning for a general DMBIC. The obtained achievable rate region is then specialized
to the DM-BIC under two partial order broadcast conditions:

interference-oblivious less noisy and interference-cognizant

points, the specialized rate region is shown to be equivalent to
that based on a simpler scheme that uses only superposition
coding at the broadcast transmitter. For the interferenceoblivious less noisy DM-BIC, if interference is strong, the
capacity region is given by the aforementioned two equivalent
rate regions. For the interference-cognizant less noisy DMBIC, we argue that the strong but not very strong interference
condition does not exist and in this case, we obtain the capacity
region for very strong interference.

where (a) follows from Lemma 4.
Now we consider upper-bound for R2 +R3 . The strong conn

dition implies I(X2 ; Y2n |X1 ) ≥ I(X2 ; Y3n ), [14, Lemma].
Proceeding,

To prove the converse, we use the technique proposed in
[15]. Speciﬁcally, we need the following lemma that can be
easily proved using the same arguments for [15, Lemma 1].
