interference” regime of [12], a regime where the interference
created by the cognitive transmitter at the primary user is
negligible and can be treated as noise. In the “very strong
interference” regime of [6] instead, capacity is achieved by
having the primary receiver decode the interference created
by the cognitive user and strip it from the received signal.
Capacity for the Gaussian case is also known in the “primary
decodes cognitive” regime of [8], [11], in which the cognitive
message is decoded at both receivers and pre-coded against
the interference created by the primary user at the cognitive
receiver. Despite of these and other results, available for
the cognitive interference channel, capacity is not known in
general. Capacity is actually known for a variation of the
cognitive interference channel in which the cognitive receiver
is required to decode both messages [5]. In this model, it is
not necessary for the cognitive encoder to pre-code its message
against the primary transmission and this appears to simplify
the problem of determining capacity. The difﬁculty in doing
so for the cognitive interference channel seems to follow from
the pre-coding of the cognitive codewords which hinders the
ability of the primary receivers to decode its interfering signal.
In the model we consider the primary receiver is required
to decode this interfering signal and this provides important
insights on the decoding limitations at the primary user.

Abstract—In this paper we study the cognitive interference
channel with a common message, a variation of the classical
cognitive interference channel in which the cognitive message is
decoded at both receivers. We derive the capacity for the semideterministic model, a class of channels in which the output at
the cognitive decoder is a deterministic function of the channel
inputs. We also show capacity to within a constant gap and
a constant factor for the Gaussian channel. Most of these
results are shown using an interesting transmission scheme in
which the cognitive message, decoded at both receivers, is also
pre-coded against the interference experienced at the cognitive
receiver. The pre-coding of the cognitive message does not allow
the primary decoder to reconstruct the interfering signal; the
cognitive message acts instead as a side information at the
primary receiver when decoding its intended message.
Index Terms—cognitive interference channel, superposition,
binning, semi-deterministic channel, approximate capacity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cognitive networks are transmission networks in which the
message of one user is also known at other nodes in the
network. The study of cognitive networks was inspired by
newfound abilities of smart radios to overhear the transmission
taking place over the channel and gather information about
neighboring devices [3]. The information theoretical study of
cognitive networks has so far focused on small networks with a
limited number of users and messages. A classical such model
is the cognitive interference channel [2]: a channel where two
sets of transmitter/receiver pairs communicate over a shared
channel, thus interfering with each others’ transmission. One
of the encoders in the network has knowledge of only one of
the messages to be transmitted –the primary transmitter– while
the other node has knowledge of both messages –the cognitive
transmitter. The extra knowledge at the cognitive encoder
models a smart and adaptable device that is able to acquire the
primary message from previous or simultaneous transmissions.
This model has been of great interest in recent years, see [10]
and [11] for a summary of the results, and different results
are available in the literature. Capacity is known in the “weak

Paper organization and contributions
• Sec. II: we introduce the channel model, a variation
of the cognitive interference channel in which the primary
receiver decodes both messages.
• Sec. III: we derive inner and outer bounds to the
capacity region. Both bounds are inspired by the cognitive
interference channel in the “strong interference” regime. In
this regime the primary decoder can reconstruct the signal
received at the cognitive decoder after having decoded its
intended message.
• Sec. IV: we show the capacity for the semideterministic case. In this channel the output at the cognitive
decoder is a deterministic function of the channel inputs while
the output at the primary receiver is any random function.
• Sec. V: we derive the capacity in the “very strong
interference” regime and the “primary decodes cognitive”

The capacity region is deﬁned as the closure of the region
of achievable (R1 , R2 ) pairs [1]. Standard strong-typicality is
assumed; properties may be found in [4].
In the following we focus in particular on the Gaussian
CIFC-CCM in Fig. 2. For this class of channels the input/output relationship is:
Y1 = X1 + aX2 + Z1 ,

for a, b ∈ C and for Zi ∼ NC (0, 1), where the NC indicates
complex, circularly symmetric jointly Gaussian random variables (RV). Moreover, the channel inputs are subject to the
power constraints

The Cognitive InterFerence Channel with a Common Cognitive Message (CIFC-CCM), as shown in Fig. 1, is obtained
from the classical Cognitive InterFerence Channel (CIFC)
by requiring the decoding of both messages at the primary
receiver. It consists of two transmitter-receiver pairs that exchange independent messages over a common channel. Transmitter i, i ∈ {1, 2}, has discrete input alphabet Xi and its receiver has discrete output alphabet Yi . The channel is assumed
to be memoryless with transition probability PY1 ,Y2 |X1 ,X2 .
Encoder 2 wishes to communicate a message W2 uniformly
distributed on W2 = [1 : 2N R2 ] to decoder 2 in N channel
uses at rate R2 . Similarly, encoder 1, wishes to communicate
a message W1 uniformly distributed on W1 = [1 : 2N R1 ] to
both, decoder 1 and decoder 2, in N channel uses at rate R1 .
Encoder 1 (i.e., the cognitive user) knows its own message W1
and that of encoder 2 (i.e., the primary user), W2 . A rate pair
(R1 , R2 ) is achievable if there exist sequences of encoding
functions

We start by deriving an outer bound for the capacity region
of the general CIFC-CCM. This outer bound is based on the
results known for the cognitive interference channel in the
“strong interference” regime.

well, since the cognitive receiver is decoding only the cognitive
message. The bound (3b) is obtained from Fano’s inequality
as

Proof: The outer bound is obtained from Th. III.1 by
noting that complex, circularly symmetric channel inputs
maximize all the rate bounds simultaneously.
We now develop an inner bound for the CIFC-CCM as
follows: we rate-split the primary message in public and
private part. The primary private message is superposed to
the public primary message; the cognitive common message
is superposed to the primary public message and pre-coded
against the primary private message.

following region is achievable for a general CIFC-CCM

where Q is the time sharing RV, uniformly distributed in the

The bound (3c) is derived as:

R1 ≤ I(Y1 ; U1c |U2c ) − I(U1c ; X2 |U2c ),
R1 ≤ I(Y2 ; X1 |X2 , U2c ),

for all the distributions PX1 ,X2 . Condition (4) corresponds
to the “strong interference” regime for the CIFC. When
dropping (3b) from the expression in (3), one obtains the
“strong interference” outer bound for the CIFC [6]. This outer
bound is capacity in the “very strong interference” regime
for the general CIFC and is capacity in the “primary decodes
cognitive” regime for the Gaussian CIFC.

Rem. III.2 formally deﬁnes the relationship between the
CIFC in “strong interference” and the CIFC-CCM. For a CIFC
for which (4) holds, there is no loss of optimality in having
the primary receiver decode both messages. For a CIFC-CCM
for which (4) holds, the rate of the cognitive message is not
bounded by the decoding capabilities of the primary receiver.
For these reasons, a CIFC for which (4) holds is equivalent
to a CIFC-CCM for which (4) holds. We avoid referring to
the condition in (4) as “strong interference” condition as one
cannot properly deﬁne “interference” in the CIFC-CCM since
the primary receiver is decoding both the cognitive message
and the primary message.
The next theorem specializes the outer bound of Th. III.1
to the Gaussian channel in (1).

Th. III.4, is provided in Fig 3: the blue boxes represent
codewords associated with the primary message while the

Note that the achievable region in [10, Th. 7] for the CIFC
has less bounds than the region in Th. III.4. This follows from

Capacity in the “very strong interference” regime for the
CIFC is achieved by having both receivers decode both
messages and by superposing the cognitive message over
the primary message [6]. This strategy achieves capacity
for a class of CIFC-CCM that we also term “very strong
interference” regime. This deﬁnition is not fully accurate since
the primary receiver decodes both messages, but is coherent
with the literature.

not required in the CIFC and some error events in the scheme
of Th. III.4 are not errors in the achievable scheme of [10, Th.

the region in (3) is capacity.

The semi-deterministic CIFC-CCM is a general CIFCCCM where the channel output at the cognitive decoder is
a deterministic function of the channel inputs, i.e.
Y1 = fY1 (X1 , X2 )

Proof: Consider the scheme in (6). For X2 = U2c and
U1c = X1 the achievable region is
R1 ≤ I(Y1 ; X1 |X2 ),
R1 ≤ I(Y2 ; X1 |X2 ),
R1 + R2 ≤ I(Y1 ; X1 , X2 ),

the capacity of the Gaussian CIFC-CCM is given by (5).
Proof: Condition (16) is derived from (14) for the Gaussian model in (1). Details can be found in [11, App. B].
We can extend the “primary decodes cognitive” regime of
[11] to the Gaussian CIFC-CCM:

(12)

For the assignment U1c = Y1 , which is possible given (9), the
inner bound in (11) coincides with (10) since

then (5) is the capacity of the Gaussian CIFC-CCM.
Proof: Consider the scheme in (11) with the assignment

RHS−(11d) = H(Y1 ) + H(Y2 |Y1 ) + H(Y2 |X1 , X2 )
= I(Y2 ; X1 , X2 ) + H(Y1 |Y2 ) ≥ RHS−(11c),

(15d)

Under condition (14) the bound in (15c) can be eliminated
from the inner bound and the inner bound is then equivalent
to the outer bound in (3).
Remark V.2. The “very strong interference” regime for the
CIFC is deﬁned by condition (14) and (4). However, condition
(4) is not required to prove capacity for the CIFC-CCM.
The following corollary states the result of Th. V.1 for the
Gaussian case in (1).

Theorem IV.1. Capacity of the Semi-Deterministic CIFCCCM. The capacity of the semi-deterministic channel is

while the primary output is any random function of the inputs.
When condition (9) holds, binning at the cognitive transmitter
can fully pre-cancel the effect of the interference at the
cognitive receiver thus making (3a) achievable.

This scheme achieves capacity when (19b) is larger than (19c).
The conditions were determined in [11] to prove the “primary

Remark V.5. The “primary decodes cognitive” regime for the
CIFC is deﬁned by condition (17) and condition (4) which is
given by |b| ≥ 1 in the Gaussian case. Condition (4) is not
required to prove capacity for the CIFC-CCM. The capacity
of the Gaussian CIFC-CCM for |b| ≤ 1 is given by Corollary
V.4.

regime where binning at the cognitive transmitter achieves
capacity. For the Gaussian case we prove capacity to within a
constant gap of 1.87 bit/s/Hz and to within a constant factor
of two.

Theorem VI.1. Capacity to within 1.87 bits/s/Hz. For any
Gaussian CIFC-CCM, the outer bound region in (5) can be

VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper we study a variation of the classical cognitive
interference channel where the primary receiver decodes both
messages. This channel is related to the cognitive interference
channel in the “strong interference” regime and many results
for this channel apply to the model under consideration. We
derive the capacity for the semi-deterministic case, where the
cognitive output is a deterministic function of the channel
inputs. We also show capacity in the “very strong interference”
