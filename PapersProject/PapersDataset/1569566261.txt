The Supermarket Game
Jiaming Xu and Bruce Hajek

a central dispatcher or tracker; (2) global workload or queue
length information is not available and customers randomly
choose a ﬁnite number of servers to probe; (3) there is cost
associated with probing a server and waiting in a queue.
Examples of such scenarios are the following:
• Network routing: customers represent trafﬁc ﬂows and
servers represent possible routes from a given source to
a destination. A trafﬁc ﬂow can ﬁnd the route with low
delay by probing different routes.
• Dynamic wireless spectrum access: customers represent
wireless devices and servers represent all the shared
spectrum. The wireless devices can ﬁnd the spectrum
band with low interference and congestion by probing
multiple spectrum bands.
• Cloud computing service: customers can decide how
many servers to probe in seeking the server with low
delay.
In this paper, we address the following natural questions
for these systems: How many servers will a self-interested
customer sample? Is sampling or probing more servers by
some customers beneﬁcial or detrimental to the others?

Abstract—A supermarket game is considered with N FCFS
queues with unit exponential service rate and global Poisson
arrival rate N λ. Upon arrival each customer chooses a number
of queues to be sampled uniformly at random and joins the least
loaded sampled queue. Customers are assumed to have cost for
both waiting and sampling, and they want to minimize their own
expected total cost. We study the supermarket game in a mean
ﬁeld model that corresponds to the limit as N converges to inﬁnity
in the sense that (i) for a ﬁxed symmetric customer strategy, the
joint equilibrium distribution of any ﬁxed number of queues
converges as N → ∞ to a product distribution determined by
the mean ﬁeld model and (ii) a Nash equilibrium for the mean
ﬁeld model is an ϵ-Nash equilibrium for the ﬁnite N model with
N sufﬁciently large. It is shown that there always exists a Nash
equilibrium for λ < 1 and the Nash equilibrium is unique for
λ2 ≤ 1/2. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the action of sampling more
queues by some customers has a positive externality on the other
customers.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Consider a stream of customers arriving to a multi-server
system where any server is capable of serving any customer.
Upon arrival, customers are unaware of the current queue
length at servers, so they sample a few servers and join
the server with the shortest queue among the sampled few.
Customers have time cost proportional to the waiting time
at servers and sampling cost proportional to the number of
sampled servers. Customers are self-interested and aim to
minimize their own total cost by choosing the optimal number
of servers to sample. Note that the waiting time of a customer
depends on the other customers’ choices, so it is a game among
the customers and we call it the supermarket game, because
often in supermarkets customers try to ﬁnd counters with short
queue to check out.

B. Main Results
The supermarket game with ﬁnite number of servers is
difﬁcult to analyze due to the correlation among queues at
different servers. Therefore, we study the supermarket game
in a mean ﬁeld model that corresponds to the limit as the
number of servers converges to inﬁnity. With unit exponential
service rate at servers and Poisson arrival of customers, it is
shown that:
• There exists a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for all
arrival rates per server less than one.
• The action of sampling more servers by some customers
has a positive externality on the other customers.
• Nash equilibrium is unique for arrival rates per server
√
less than or equal to 1/ 2.
• Nash equilibrium is unique if and only if a local monotonicity condition is satisﬁed. This condition is used to
explore the uniqueness numerically for arrival rates per
√
server larger than 1/ 2.
• Multiple Nash equilibria exist for a particular example
with arrival rates per server equal to 0.999.
We also show that the mean ﬁeld model arises naturally as
the limit of supermarket game with ﬁnite number of servers:
• The joint equilibrium distribution of any ﬁxed number of
queues converges to a product distribution determined by
the mean ﬁeld model as the number of queues converge
to inﬁnity.

A. Motivation
The supermarket game is a simple model for analyzing distributed load balancing in transportation and communication
networks. Load balancing ensures efﬁcient resource utilization
and improves the quality of service, by evenly distributing the
workload across multiple servers. Traditionally, load balancing
is fulﬁlled by a central dispatcher that assigns the newly
arriving work to the server with the least workload. As modern
or future networks become larger and increasingly distributed,
such central dispatcher may not exist, and thus the load
balancing has to be carried out by customers themselves.
Hence, the supermarket game is relevant in scenarios where (1)
customers choose which server to join without directions from

sampled queue with the least number of customers, ties being
resolved uniformly at random. Customers are assumed to have
cost c per unit waiting time and cs for sampling one queue.
These cost parameters are the same for all the customers.
For a ﬁxed customer i, if she chooses Li queues to sample,
and all the other customers choose L−i , then by PASTA
(Poisson arrival sees time average), the expected total cost
of customer i is given by

C. Related Work
The supermarket game is formulated based on the classical
supermarket model with N parallel queues in which customers
sample a ﬁxed number L of queues uniformly at random
and join the shortest sampled queue. The supermarket model
has been extensively studied in the literature [1], [2], [3],
[4], [5] using the mean ﬁeld approach. The recent paper
by Bramson et. al. [6] analyzes the supermarket model with
general service time distributions. Ganesh et. al. [7] studies a
variant of the supermarket model, where the customers initially
join an arbitrary server, but may switch to other servers later
independently at random.
In addition to the supermarket model, the mean ﬁeld approach has also been used to analyze scheduling in queueing
networks, such as the CSMA algorithm in a wireless local
area network [8] and downlink transmission scheduling [9].
Also, a recent work [10] investigates the performance tradeoff
between centralized and distributed scheduling in a multiserver system for the mean ﬁeld model. However, none of
above work considers a game-theoretic framework.
The supermarket game proposed in this paper falls into
a large research area involving equilibrium behavior of customers and servers, known as queueing games. A comprehensive survey can be found in [11]. A particularly relevant paper
[12] studies a two line queueing system, where upon arrival
each customer decides whether to purchase the information
about which line is shorter, or randomly select one of the
lines.
Finally, the supermarket game is also related to and partially
motivated by the theory of mean ﬁeld games in the context of
dynamical games [13], [14]. The mean ﬁeld game approach
studies a weakly coupled, N player game by letting N →
∞. However, we caution that in the supermarket game, we
consider an inﬁnite sequence of customers instead of ﬁnitely
many customers, which is different from an N player game.

C(Li , L−i ) = cE[W (Li , L−i )] + cs Li ,

(1)

where E[W (Li , L−i )] is the expected waiting time (service
time included) under the stationary distribution. The goal of
customer i is to minimize her own expected total cost by
choosing the optimal Li .
Since the supermarket game is symmetric in the customers,
we limit ourselves to symmetric strategies. We call L⋆ ∈ L a
pure strategy Nash equilibrium, if
C(L⋆ , L⋆ ) ≤ C(Li , L⋆ ), for all Li ∈ L.
Since a pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not always exist,
we are also interested in mixed strategy Nash equilibria.
Let P(L) denote the set of all probability distributions
over L. The mixed strategy µi for customer i is simply a
probability distribution in P(L), i.e., µi (Li ) is the probability
that customer i samples Li queues. If all the other customers
use the mixed strategy µ−i , then the expected total cost of
customer i using µi is given by
C(µi , µ−i ) =

Lmax

C(Li , µ−i )µi (Li ),

where C(Li , µ−i ) is the expected total cost of customer i
choosing Li given all the others choose the mixed strategy
µ−i .
Deﬁne the best response correspondence for customer i as
BR(µ−i ) := arg minµi C(µi , µ−i ). The correspondence BR is
a set-valued function from P(L) to subsets of P(L). We call
µ⋆ ∈ P(L) a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium if
C(µ⋆ , µ⋆ ) ≤ C(µi , µ⋆ ), for all µi ∈ P(L).

A. Mean Field Model

Next, we prove two key lemmas which are useful in the
sequel.

In this subsection, we derive an expression for the expected
total cost incurred by a customer in a mean ﬁeld model, by
assuming that queue lengths (including customers in service)
are independent and identically distributed.
Suppose all the customers except customer i use the mixed
strategy µ−i , and let rt (k) denote the fraction of queues with
at least k customers at time t in the mean ﬁeld model. Then,
the mean ﬁeld equation is given by

Lemma 1. The best response set BR(µ−i ) consists of probability measures concentrated on an integer or two consecutive
integers.
Proof: Let µ ∈ BR(µ−i ). Suppose there exists L1 <
L2 < L3 ∈ L such that µ(L1 ) > 0 and µ(L3 ) > 0. Then, by
the deﬁnition of BR,
C(L1 , µ−i ) = C(L3 , µ−i ) ≤ C(L2 , µ−i ),

Lmax

which contradicts the fact that C(L, µ−i ) is strictly convex in
L and thus the conclusion follows.

l=1

− (rt (k) − rt (k + 1)),

(3)

Remark 1. Lemma 1 implies that a probability measure µ ∈
BR(µ−i ) can be identiﬁed with a unique real number L ∈
[1, Lmax ]. A number L ∈ [1, Lmax ] with L = ⌊L⌋ + p for
some 0 ≤ p < 1 is identiﬁed with the probability measure
with mass 1 − p at ⌊L⌋ and p at ⌊L⌋ + 1. Thus, we use real
numbers to refer to probability measures in BR(µ−i ).

which is rigorously derived in [15]. For now, let us provide
some intuition for each of the drift terms in (3):
l
l
The term λµ−i (l)(rt (k − 1) − rt (k)) corresponds to the arrivals of customers sampling l queues. Because queue lengths
l
are i.i.d, rt (k − 1) is the probability that the minimum queue
length of l uniformly sampled queues is greater than or equal
l
l
to k − 1. Thus, (rt (k − 1) − rt (k)) is the probability that
the minimum queue length of l uniformly sampled queues is
k−1, which is the same as the probability that a customer who
samples l queues joins a queue with k − 1 customers. Note
that rt (k) is increased if a customer joins a queue with k − 1
customers. Therefore, the ﬁrst term in (3) is the aggregate drift
for rt (k) corresponding to arrivals.
The term (rt (k) − rt (k + 1)) corresponds to departures of
customers at queues with exactly k customers.
t (k)
Since we are interested in the stationary regime, set drdt =
0 to yield equations for the equilibrium distribution denoted
by rµ−i (k), k ≥ 0. For k ≥ 1,

The next lemma translates the stochastic dominance relations between strategies into the stochastic dominance relations between mean ﬁeld equilibrium distributions.
Lemma 2. Fix any µ1 , µ2 ∈ P(L) such that µ1 ≤st µ2 . Then,
for all k ∈ N, rµ1 (k) ≥ rµ2 (k). Furthermore, if µ1 <st µ2 ,
then for all k ≥ 2, rµ1 (k) > rµ2 (k). Also, it follows that for
all k ∈ N and all µ ∈ P(L), rµ (k) ≤ λk and C(L, µ) is
bounded independently of L and µ.
Proof: Since µ1 ≤st µ2 , it follows that for all x ∈ [0, 1],
uµ1 (x) ≥ uµ2 (x). We prove the lemma by induction. If k = 0,
then rµ1 (0) = rµ2 (0) = 1 and rµ1 (0) ≥ rµ2 (0) trivially holds.
If rµ1 (k − 1) ≥ rµ2 (k − 1), then
rµ1 (k) = λuµ1 [rµ1 (k − 1)] ≥ λuµ1 [rµ2 (k − 1)]
≥ λuµ2 [rµ2 (k − 1)] = rµ2 (k).

where the random variable L is distributed as µ−i . By summing the above equation for k0 ≤ k < +∞ using telescoping
sums and changing k0 to k, it follows that

Therefore, for all k ∈ N, rµ1 (k) ≥ rµ2 (k). Moreover, if
µ1 <st µ2 , it follows that for all x ∈ (0, 1), uµ1 (x) > uµ2 (x).
Thus, for all k ≥ 2, rµ1 (k) > rµ2 (k).
Let µ1 = δ1 be a point measure at singleton 1. Then,
rµ1 (k) = λk . Because for any µ ∈ P(L), δ1 ≤st µ, then
rµ (k) ≤ λk and C(L, µ) ≤ c/(1 − λ) + cs Lmax .

B. Existence and Uniqueness of Nash Equilibrium
In this subsection, we show the existence of a mixed strategy
Nash equilibrium. It is easy to see that if there exists µ⋆ such
that µ⋆ ∈ BR(µ⋆ ), i.e., µ⋆ is a ﬁxed point of the best response
correspondence, then µ⋆ is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
Thus, it sufﬁces to show the existence of such a ﬁxed point.
The Kakutani ﬁxed point theorem is used to prove it [15].

For customer i, her marginal value of sampling at an integer
Li with all the others adopting µ−i , is deﬁned as

Since g(L) = x is convex in L ∈ R for x ≥ 0 and strictly
convex for 0 < x < 1, it follows that E[W (L, µ−i )] and
C(L, µ−i ) are strictly convex in L ∈ R.

Intuitively, V (Li , µ−i ) characterizes the reduction of expected
waiting time when customer i increases the number of sampled
queues from Li to Li + 1. For ease of notation, deﬁne
V (0, µi ) = ∞ and V (Lmax , µi ) = 0. Since E[W (L, µ−i )]
is strictly convex in L ∈ R, V (Li , µ−i ) is strictly decreasing
in Li . The following lemma characterizes the best response
using V (Li , µ−i ).

sometimes a customer tends to sample more queues when
all the others sample more queues. This follow the crowd
behavior can lead to multiple Nash equilibria. Such a scenario
is described in the sequel.
Next, we introduce a local monotonicity condition and show
the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for all values of c and cs
if and only if the local monotonicity condition is satisﬁed.

Lemma 3. Fix any µ−i ∈ P(L) and any integer Li ∈ L.
Then Li ∈ BR(µ−i ) if and only if

Deﬁnition 1. Given 0 < λ < 1 and any integer Lmax ≥ 1,
the local monotonicity condition is satisﬁed for (λ, Lmax ) if
V (L, L + q) is strictly decreasing over 0 ≤ q ≤ 1 for each
integer L with 1 ≤ L ≤ Lmax − 1.

V (Li , µ−i ) ≤ cs /c ≤ V (Li − 1, µ−i ).

(6)

Furthermore, ﬁx any non-integer Li ∈ [1, Lmax ]. Then Li ∈
BR(µ−i ) if and only if
V (⌊Li ⌋, µ−i ) = cs /c.

Theorem 3. Given 0 < λ < 1 and any integer Lmax ≥ 1, the
supermarket game in the mean ﬁeld model has a unique Nash
equilibrium for all values of c and cs , if and only if the local
monotonicity condition is satisﬁed for (λ, Lmax ).

(7)

The next lemma proves a global monotonicity property of
V (Li , µ−i ) in case λ2 ≤ 1/2, which is useful for showing the
uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in that case.

Numerical results show that when λ = 0.99, V (L, L + q)
is indeed strictly decreasing with respect to 0 ≤ q ≤ 1 for
L = 1, . . . , 9. For L ≥ 10,

Lemma 4. Assume λ2 ≤ 1/2 and ﬁx any µ−i , µ−i ∈ P(L)

rL+q (2) ≤ rL (2) ≤ r10 (2) ≤ L/(L + 1),
which implies that V (L, L + q) is strictly decreasing over 0 ≤
q ≤ 1, in view of the proof for Lemma 4. Therefore, for
λ = 0.99 and any integer Lmax ≥ 1, there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium for all values of c and cs . However, through
numerical experiments, we ﬁnd that when λ = 0.999 and
Lmax = 25, V (L, L + q) is strictly increasing in q for L =
18, . . . , 24. Therefore, multiple Nash equilibria exist if cs /c =
0.0148. In particular, L = 19, . . . , 24 are pure strategy Nash
equilibria and mixed strategy Nash equilibria exist between
each two consecutive pure strategy Nash equilibria.

we prove a stronger conclusion, that is, for k ≥ 2,

2
Therefore, g(rµ−i (k)) > g(rµ−i (k)), ∀k ≥ 2, and thus
˜
equation (8) holds.
Since V (Li , µ−i ) > V (Li , µ−i ), it is not hard to derive that
˜
˜
Li ≤ Li using Lemma 3 [15].
Lemma 4 implies that for λ2 ≤ 1/2, a customer tends to
sample fewer queues when all the other customers sample
more queues. This is an instance of avoid the crowd behavior
[11], leading to uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium.

C. Externality
The action of sampling more queues by some customers has
an effect on the waiting time of others. This effect is called
the externality associated with the action and the externality
is positive if the action reduces the mean waiting time of the
other customers. In this subsection, the externality in the mean
ﬁeld model is analyzed. It is not clear whether the externality is
positive at ﬁrst sight. On one hand, choosing a large number of
queues to sample helps a customer ﬁnd a less loaded queue and
hence reduces future arrivals’ opportunity to ﬁnd lightly loaded
queues. On the other hand, it also leads to a well balanced
system and reduces the average waiting time.
The following corollary of Lemma 2 implies that the action
of sampling more queues by some customers has a positive
externality on the other customers in the mean ﬁeld model. To
see it, suppose in system 1, all the customers adopt a strategy
µ1 ; while in system 2, a fraction 0 < p ≤ 1 of them samples
more queues, i.e., adopts a new strategy µ3 with µ1 <st µ3
and all the others still adopt the strategy µ1 . For system 2, it
is equivalent to assume that all the customers adopt a strategy
µ2 with µ2 = pµ3 + (1 − p)µ1 . It follows that µ1 <st µ2 . By
Corollary 1, system 2 has smaller mean waiting time.

Theorem 2. If λ2 ≤ 1 , the supermarket game has a unique
2
Nash equilibrium in the mean ﬁeld model.
Proof: A Nash equilibrium exists by Theorem 1. Let
˜
L⋆ , L⋆ ∈ [1, Lmax ] denote two possible Nash equilibria; we
˜
show that L⋆ = L⋆ .
˜
Without loss of generality, suppose L⋆ < L⋆ ; by Lemma 4,
˜
L⋆ ≥ L⋆ , which is a contradiction and concludes the proof.
However, the marginal value of sampling V (Li , L−i ) is
not always decreasing in L−i ∈ [1, Lmax ] (L−i refers to a
probability distribution here) for all λ < 1. By numerical
results, we ﬁnd that when λ = 0.99 and Li = 5, V (Li , L−i )
is increasing with L−i for 11 ≤ L−i ≤ 16. This implies that

4

Corollary 1. If µ1 , µ2 ∈ P(L) with µ1 <st µ2 , then for all
L ∈ L, E[W (L, µ1 )] > E[W (L, µ2 )].

V. C ONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that the equilibrium picture for the
supermarket game can be somewhat complicated, at least if
0.5 < λ2 < 1. In particular, there may be multiple Nash
equilibria, stemming from the fact that customers do not
always have an “avoid the crowd” response as when λ2 ≤ 0.5.
However, this complication seems to occur only for λ close to
one and Lmax fairly large. Also, at least in the mean ﬁeld
limit model, the positive externality of increased sampling
holds for the whole range λ < 1. For the ﬁnite N model, the
coupling result in [2] shows that sampling more queues by
some customers has a positive externality on customers who
only sample one queue. However, for customers who sample
more than one queue, the samplings of more queues by other
customers can have a negative externality [15].

Proof: Because µ1 <st µ2 , by Lemma 2, rµ1 (k) >
rµ2 (k), ∀k ≥ 2. Hence, the conclusion follows by invoking
the deﬁnition of E[W (L, µ)].
Remark 2. Corollary 1 further implies that customers sample
no more queues for any Nash equilibrium than for the socially
optimal strategy. See [15] for the details.
IV. J USTIFICATION OF M EAN F IELD M ODEL
In this section, we justify the mean ﬁeld model as the
limit of the supermarket game with ﬁnite N as N → ∞.
Let W (N ) (µi , µ−i ) and C (N ) (µi , µ−i ) denote customer i’s
waiting time and total average cost for N queues. Then, the
expected waiting time can be derived as

E[W (N ) (Li , µ−i )] = E[min{Q(N ) (1), . . . , Q(N ) (Li )}] + 1,
where Q(N ) (i) is the length of the ith sampled queue in
equilibrium.
The following theorem shows that the mean ﬁeld model
corresponds to the limit as N → ∞.
Theorem 4. Let Z denote the random variable associated
with the mean ﬁeld equilibrium distribution rµ−i (k), then for
any ﬁxed integer Li ≥ 1, as N → ∞,
L (Q(N ) (1), . . . , Q(N ) (Li )) =⇒ L (Z)⊗Li .
Remark 3. The proof of Theorem 4 is based on the idea of
propagation of chaos [16], [3]. See [15] for the full proof.
Next, the deﬁnition of ϵ-Nash equilibrium in the ﬁnite N
model is introduced.
Deﬁnition 2. We call µ⋆ ∈ P(L) an ϵ-Nash equilibrium for
a ﬁnite N , if for any ϵ > 0,
C (N ) (µ⋆ , µ⋆ ) ≤ C (N ) (µ, µ⋆ ) + ϵ, for all µ ∈ P(L).
Theorem 5. Let µ⋆ be a Nash equilibrium for the supermarket
game in the mean ﬁeld model, then µ⋆ is an ϵ-Nash equilibrium
in the ﬁnite N model for N sufﬁciently large.
Proof: By the coupling result given in [15], [2], it
follows that W (N ) (Li , µ−i ) is uniformly integrable. In view
of Theorem 4, it follows that for each ϵ > 0, there exists
N0 ∈ N such that when N ≥ N0 ,
|E[W (N ) (Li , µ−i )] − E[W (Li , µ−i )]| ≤

ϵ
,

and thus
|C (N ) (µ, µ−i ) − C(µ, µ−i )| ≤ ϵ/2,
where W (Li , µ−i ) and C(µ, µ−i ) are the waiting time and
total average cost respectively in the mean ﬁeld model. Then
using the deﬁnition of µ⋆ , the conclusion follows easily.
