Abstract— The multiple unicast network coding conjecture
states that for multiple unicast in an undirected network, network
coding is equivalent to routing. Simple and intuitive as it appears,
the conjecture has remained open since its proposal in 2004
[1], [2], and is now a well-known unsolved problem in the
ﬁeld of network coding. In this work, we provide a proof to
the conjecture in its space/geometric version. Space information
ﬂow is a new paradigm being proposed [3], [4]. It studies
the transmission of information in a geometric space, where
information ﬂows are free to propagate along any trajectories,
and may be encoded wherever they meet. The goal is to minimize
a natural bandwidth-distance sum-product (network volume),
while sustaining end-to-end unicast and multicast communication
demands among terminals at known coordinates. The conjecture
is true in networks only if it is true in space. Our main result is
that network coding is indeed equivalent to routing in the space
model. Besides its own merit, this partially veriﬁes the original
conjecture, and further leads to a geometric framework [5] for
a hopeful proof to the conjecture.

The work of Zongpeng Li

However, no >1 coding advantage has been observed
for multiple unicast in the undirected setting. For example,
Fig. 1(B) shows a MCF with end-to-end ﬂow rate of 1 for
each of the two unicast sessions. Li and Li [1] and Harvey et
al. [2] conjectured that network coding is equivalent to routing
for multiple unicast in undirected networks.

I. BACKGROUND AND I NTRODUCTION
A. The Multiple Unicast Network Coding Conjecture
Departing from the classic store-and-forward principle of
data networking, network coding encourages information ﬂows
to be “mixed” in the middle of a network, via means of coding
[6], [7]. While network coding for a single communication
session (unicast, broadcast or multicast) is well understood by
now, the case of multiple independent sessions (multi-source,
multi-sink) is much harder, with less results known [8]. A
basic scenario in the latter is the multiple unicast setting, where
multiple independent one-to-one communication demands coexist in a network. With routing, the optimal solution can be
computed by solving a multicommodity ﬂow (MCF) linear
program; with network coding, the structure and the computational complexity of the optimal solution are largely unknown.
In directed networks, network coding can augment the
capacity region of multiple unicast. For example, Fig. 1(A)
shows a network coding solution for two unicast sessions in
a directed network, where each session has a throughput of 1.
Without network coding, it is not hard to verify that achieving
a throughput of 1 and 1 for both sessions concurrently is
infeasible, given the pre-deﬁned link directions. In general,
the coding advantage, the ratio of the maximum throughput

Despite a series of research effort devoted [10]–[12], rather
limited progresses have been made towards settling this fundamental problem in network coding. Besides “easy” cases
where the cut set bounds can be achieved without network
coding [1], [2], the conjecture has been veriﬁed only in small,
ﬁxed networks and their variations, such as the OkamuraSeymour network [10], [11]. It is worth noting that such
veriﬁcation already involves new tools in network information theory such as information dominance [10], input-output
equality and crypto equality [11]. A growing agreement is
that new tools beyond a “simple blend” of graph theory and
information theory are required for eventually settling the
conjecture. In this work, we prove the geometric version of the
multiple unicast conjecture, by further incorporating mature
techniques in geometry into the picture.
In 2007, Mitzenmacher et al. compiled a list of seven open
problems in network coding [13], where the multiple unicast
conjecture appears as problem number 1. Chekuri commented
that claiming an equivalence between network coding and
routing for all undirected networks is a “bold conjecture”, and
that the problem of fully understanding network coding for
multiple unicast sessions is still “wild open” ( [14], p51-55).

The work of Zongpeng Li was partially supported by a grant from the
University Grants Committee (Project No. AoE/E-02/08) of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, China.

B. Space Information Flow
Space information ﬂow is a new subject of study being
proposed [3], [4]. It considers terminals at known locations
in a geometric space, with unicast, broadcast or multicast
communication demands among them. Information ﬂows can
be transmitted along any trajectories in the space, and may be
replicated wherever desired, or encoded wherever they meet.
The goal is to minimize the total bandwidth-distance sumproduct, while sustaining given end-to-end communication
rates. Besides being a conceivable theoretical problem of
“network coding in space”, space information ﬂow models the
min-cost design of a blueprint of a communication network,
which deserves renewed research attention given network
coding [3]. As we will discuss later, space information ﬂow
also opens the door to geometric approaches for studying
network information ﬂow problems, including in particular the
multiple unicast network coding conjecture in graphs.

multiple unicast solution here is that, at any given point A, the
total amount of ﬂows at A, aggregated from both directions,
should be at least the total demand of unicast sessions whose
terminals reside on different sides of A. We take integration
on both sides of this inequality along all points in the 1-D
space, and prove that network coding can not improve upon
an optimal solution based on routing (MCF).
For the general case of a h-D space, h ≥ 2, our approach is
to reduce the problem into 1-D, by applying the mature tool of
projection in geometry. We prove that, if network coding can
outperform MCF in h-D, then it can do so in 1-D, thereby
leading to a contradiction. More speciﬁcally, we show that
in a given case where a network coding based solution has a
smaller cost than that of MCF, there must exist a 1-D subspace,
onto which the projection of the network coding solution is
still cheaper than the projection of the MCF solution. The
challenge here is that such a “good” candidate subspace for
projection is hard to ﬁnd. It is problem dependent and no
ﬁxed subspace always works. We prove the existence of such
an elusive subspace without explicitly identifying it, through
an argument of integrating the projected network coding and
MCF solutions over all possible 1-D rays from origin.

D. Relevance and Discussions
In Sec. II-C, we prove that the cost advantage, the potential
advantage of network coding over routing in terms of reducing
data transmission cost, is always at least as high in networks
than in space. Therefore, our result in this paper partially
veriﬁes the original multiple unicast network coding conjecture
in networks.
Perhaps more interesting is that the new space information
ﬂow perspective provides a promising direction for attacking
the original conjecture itself. In a sibling work [5], we describe
a geometric framework that is hopeful for eventually resolving
the original conjecture. We brieﬂy preview this geometric
framework, as well its connection to this work, in Sec. III-D.
Given that network coding is equivalent to routing for
multiple unicast in a Euclidean space, it is interesting to ask
whether the same holds for multicast. In two sibling work [3],
[4], we study the multicast problem in space, with network
coding explicitly considered. There we present examples that
show network coding and routing are indeed different in
space, prove upper-bounds on the cost advantage, analyze the
achievability of optimality with ﬁnite solutions, and discuss
the complexity of optimal multicast in a geometric space.

Fig. 2. A 2-D example of space information ﬂow: meeting communication
demands among nodes in space. A min-cost solution is to be computed, for
three unit-demand unicast sessions from s1 to t1 , from s2 to t2 and from
s3 to t3 , respectively (left). Given network coding, is there a solution better
than MCF (right)?

For a quick feel of space information ﬂow, consider three
unicast sessions each with unit demand, from s 1 to t1 , from s2
to t2 and from s 3 to t3 , respectively, in a 2-D Euclidean space
as shown in Fig.1. We can route an information ﬂow along
any path in space, insert relay nodes wherever desired, and
replicate or encode information ﬂows wherever desired. We
aim to minimize the volume of the solution network induced,
e ||e||f (e). Here e is a link employed for ﬂow transmission,
||e|| is the length of e in space, and f (e) is the rate of
information ﬂow routed across e. What is the optimal solution
for satisfying the three unicast demands? Can network coding
lead to better solutions than routing (MCF)? Recent examples
show that network coding can outperform routing when the
demand in space is multicast [3], [4]. What about multiple
unicast?

C. Summary of Results
Our main result in this work is that network coding is
equivalent to routing, for multiple unicast in the new space
information ﬂow model. We restrict our attention to Euclidean spaces; the case of non-Euclidean spaces, such as ndimensional spaces under Chebyshev distance, is still being
investigated [5].
We ﬁrst analyze the simple case of a 1-D space, where a
single point constitutes a cut. A natural requirement on a valid

A. Network Information Flow
We represent an existing network, directed or undirected,
using a graph G = (V, E). The vector c ∈ Z E stores capacities
+
of links in E. Here Z+ is the set of positive integers. Another
vector w ∈ QE represents the distance or cost of links in
+
E, and we can be interpreted as the cost of routing a unit
ﬂow through that link. Here Q + represents the set of positive
rational numbers.

For the min-cost multiple unicast problem, we consider k
unicast sessions co-existing in network G, and let s i and ti be
the sender and receiver of session i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. We use r to
denote the target throughput vector of the k sessions, and r i is
the required throughput of session i. Without network coding,
a solution to the multiple unicast problem is a multicommodity
ﬂow (MCF), which can be represented using a link ﬂow vector
f ∈ QE . The min-cost MCF can be computed by solving a
+
linear program [1], [2].
A network coding solution to the multiple unicast problem
has two components: (A) a ﬂow component, for how much
ﬂow to transmit over each link, and (B) a coding component,
for where and how to encode and decode the information
ﬂows. We denote the underlying link ﬂow vector in (A) using
f ∈ QE too. In undirected networks, a network coding scheme
+
may be dynamic in that the transmission scheme is a timeslotted one (a convolutional code), and a different ﬂow routing
and coding scheme is adopted in each different time slot [6],
[10]. In this case, we simply let f e be the time-average ﬂow
rate at link e. There is no known linear program of polynomial
size that computes the min-cost network coding solution.

We can create a corresponding problem instance ∆ d for the
directed setting, by viewing f as the directed network, while
keeping the terminal nodes, link costs and target throughput
intact. With network coding, the cost of the optimal solution
is the same in ∆d and in ∆u . Without network coding, the
cost of the optimal solution can only increase from ∆ u to ∆d ,
since the latter is more restrictive. Therefore β d ≥ βu .
The proof to β u ≥ βs is similar, by viewing the underlying
ﬂow f of the optimal network coding solution for ∆ s as an
undirected network. The directions in f are ignored. The cost
of a link e is taken as ||e|| h .
Given Theorem 2.1, we know that all upper-bounds on the
cost advantage proven for the undirected model are still valid
in the space model. Conversely, all lower-bounds that we can
prove for the space model will also be valid for the undirected
model. For example, an upper-bound of 2 is known for cost
advantage in undirected multicast networks [15]–[17]. This
bound automatically holds for multicast in a space of any
dimension. In Sec. III, we prove that the cost advantage for
multiple unicast is always 1 in space. Unfortunately, this does
not directly imply the multiple unicast conjecture in undirected
networks. We discuss how this bound is connected to the
conjecture in Sec. III-D.

B. Space Information Flow
In the space information ﬂow problem, we are given a
set of terminal nodes, with (multiple) unicast or multicast
communication demand. The space we consider in this work
is a h-D Euclidean space, h ≥ 1. A node u has coordinate
(x1,u , x2,u , . . . , xh,u ). The Euclidean distance between two
nodes u and v is

A. The Multiple Unicast Conjecture for Network Information
Flow
In their original work where the multiple unicast conjecture
was proposed [1], Li and Li ﬁrst formulated the conjecture in
the throughput domain, and then applied linear programming
duality to translate it into an equivalent version in the cost
domain.
The Multiple Unicast Conjecture [1], [2]
Throughput domain: For k independent unicast sessions
in a capacitated undirected network (G, c), a throughput
vector r is feasible with network coding if and only if it is
feasible with routing.
Cost domain: Let f be the underlying ﬂow vector of a
network coding solution for k independent unicast sessions
with throughput vector r, in a cost-weighted undirected
network (G, w). Then
e we fe ≥
i di ri , where di is
the shortest path distance between the sender and receiver
of session i under metric w.

Given a space information ﬂow vector f , a network can be
induced, over the same nodes and links as in f , by viewing
fe as the capacity of e. The distance of e is denoted as ||e|| h .
The cost of f is then e ||e||h fe . This reﬂects the general rule
that the longer and the wider a communication cable, the more
expensive it is. For the sake of cost minimization, apparently,
only straight line segments need to be considered in f .

C. Paradigm Comparison

Intuitively, the throughput version of the conjecture claims
that network coding cannot help improve throughput, while the
cost version claims that network coding cannot help reduce
transmission cost. In the rest of this section, we prove the
cost version of the multiple unicast conjecture for space
information ﬂow, where the cost w e becomes, naturally, the
Euclidean length ||e|| of link e.

We can establish a connection between the cost advantage
in space and that in graphs. Given a problem instance, in the
form of either multiple unicast or multicast, let β d , βu and
βs be the max cost advantage possible in directed networks,
undirected networks, and space, respectively. Then we have
the following relation among the three:
Theorem 2.1. βd ≥ βu ≥ βs .
Proof: We ﬁrst show that β d ≥ βu . Given the max cost
advantage β u in undirected networks, let ∆ u be a problem
instance where this cost advantage is achieved, and let f be
the underlying ﬂow of the optimal network coding solution.

B. Multiple Unicast in 1-D Space
In a 1-D space, each line segment (or edge) e between two
neighboring vertices forms a cut of the network. The amount
of ﬂow f 1 e over e has to be at least the total throughput

its network coding solution in 1-D by projecting their counter
parts from h-D. Our goal is to show that there exists a 1-D subspace/direction in the h-D space, onto which the projection
satisﬁes e (f 1 e ||e||1 ) < i (||si ti ||1 ri ), and therefore obtain
a contradiction to Theorem 3.1.
As shown in Fig. 4, let Φ be the surface of the h-D unit
hyper-sphere at the origin. We can enumerate all possible

to the corresponding point on Φ, let 1 be the unit vector
(1, 0, 0, . . . , 0).

sub-space (−∞, x) and the right sub-space (x, ∞), denoted

The nice property of this integration is that it is separable,
in the sense that we can perform integration for each link ﬂow

we observe that when we integrate for each line segment, the
orientation of that line segment does not matter, since we vary
the projection direction to take all possible values (= 2 ).

C. Multiple Unicast in h-D Space
We now consider multiple unicast demands in a h-D space,
for h ≥ 2. While only the cases of h = 2 and h = 3 allow
intuitive interpretations, the problem is as well-deﬁned for
higher dimensions, which is helpful in connecting to the original multiple unicast conjecture in graphs, because embedding
a graph metric into a geometric space often requires a high
dimension space [5].
We prove the multiple unicast conjecture by projecting the
problem from h-D to 1-D, and then apply Theorem 3.1. The
requirement on the projection is: a coding solution has total
cost less than the speciﬁed bound in the conjecture, only if it
does so after the projection. The main difﬁculty of the proof is
that an optimal or “good” direction for projection is actually
hard to ﬁnd. In particular, it is not sufﬁcient to always project
onto one of the axes. We show indirect evidence instead, for
the existence of such a good direction, by taking an integration
over all possible rays at origin for projection.

D. Connection to the Multiple Unicast Conjecture

in network coding. This result, together with the new space
information ﬂow perspective, leads to a new geometric framework for studying the original multiple unicast conjecture. For
the paradigm of space information ﬂows, the multicast case
appears even more interesting, where basic problems such as
the computational complexity of the optimal multicast solution
in space are yet to be investigated.

Comparing Theorem 3.2 with the original multiple unicast
conjecture in undirected networks, we note that the two
statements are rather similar. The only difference lies in the
fact that Theorem 3.2 is based on Euclidean distances, whereas
the conjecture is based on a cost metric induced from a graph.
A natural direction for settling the conjecture is then to embed
the graph metric into a geometric space, and then utilize
Theorem 3.2.
An isometric embedding of a graph G into a space is one
that preserves pairwise node distances in G. The distance
between two nodes u and v in G is the shortest path length
between u and v in G. By Theorem 3.2, we can see that, if
there exists a certain space to which an isometric embedding
of the network is feasible, and our projection based proof
technique for dimension reduction can be adapted to carry
through, then we can prove the multiple unicast conjecture.
While no Euclidean space always permits isometric embedding
of graphs, there do exist non-Euclidean spaces that satisfy this
property [5]. For embedding into Euclidean spaces, if we relax
the isometric requirement and allow a distance distortion ratio
up to α in the embedding, we can prove the cost advantage is
upper-bounded by α in the original graph.
Following this direction, we present a geometric framework
for studying the multiple unicast network coding conjecture
in a sibling work [5]. The framework consists of four major
steps: (i) translating the conjecture from throughput domain
to cost domain, (ii) embed the network into an Euclidean or
non-Euclidean space, in an isometric or low-distortion manner,
(iii) reduce the problem from high-dimension space to low
dimension space, and (iv) prove that there cannot be a counter
example to the conjecture in low dimension.
Based on this framework, we have been able to formulate
a uniﬁed proof to a number of results, including (1) the
conjecture holds for two unicast sessions, (2) the gap between
a network coding solution and a routing solutions is at
most O(log k), (3) the conjecture holds for uniform complete
graphs, (4) the gap between a √
network coding solution and
a routing solutions is at most 2 in uniform grid networks,
(5) the conjecture is true in star networks [18], and (6) the
conjecture is true in a class of inﬁnitely many layered or
bipartite networks. Among these, (1) and (2) were known
before, but were proved using different techniques. Results (3)(6) are new and not previously known. The proofs to results
(2), (3) and (4) resort to embedding into a Euclidean space,
and directly build upon the main result in this work. The
proofs to results (1), (5) and (6) resort to embedding into a
non-Euclidean space instead, where isometric embedding of a
graph metric is feasible.

IV. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE D IRECTIONS
This work is among the ﬁrst that studies the problem of
space information ﬂow, with a focus on the case of multiple
unicast sessions. We proved that for multiple unicast in a
Euclidean space, network coding is equivalent to routing. This
partially veriﬁes the well-known multiple unicast conjecture
