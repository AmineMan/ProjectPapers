Abstract—We study the problem of key-distillation for a source
model, with a one-way and rate-limited public communication
between two legitimate users. Although, the secret-key capacity
is already known, we provide an alternative achievability scheme,
that directly translates into practical designs. We consider a
sequential key-distillation strategy, which consists of a reconciliation phase followed by a privacy ampliﬁcation phase performed
with extractors. We determine the reconciliation capacity and
show that, for a degraded source, such a sequential strategy leads
to an optimal key-distillation strategy that achieves the secret-key
capacity. We illustrate our results in the case of a binary source
model.

design; indeed, reconciliation can be efﬁciently implemented
with LDPC codes [9][10] and privacy ampliﬁcation can be
performed with hash functions or with extractors [7][8]. Moreover, for a source model [2][11] with a public channel of
inﬁnite capacity, such a strategy is optimal and both phases
can be optimized and designed independently, thus allowing a

of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation [3].
In this paper, we study sequential-key distillation with
rate-limited public communication to account for realistic
constraints (real equipment may have limited bandwidth re1
sources, such as in a wireless sensors network). Although, the
secret-key capacity is already known, we provide an achievability scheme that, unlike the one in [3], easily translates into
practical codes. The main contributions are
• the characterization of the one-way rate-limited reconciliation capacity;
• the proof that, for a degraded source, the sequential
application of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation
with extractors, is an optimal key-distillation strategy for
a one-way rate-limited public channel;
• the illustration of our results in the binary case, for which
reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation can be designed
and optimized independently.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we formally introduce the problem studied in the
paper. In Section III, we characterize the one-way rate-limited
reconciliation capacity, and we prove that the sequential
application of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation with
extractors is an optimal key-distillation strategy. In Section IV,
we illustrate our results in the binary case.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Information-theoretic secret-key agreement protocols [1][2]
draw their strength from a security relying on informationtheoretic metrics rather than on complexity theory, thereby
avoiding the assumption of limited computational power for
1
the eavesdropper. In such protocols, two legitimate users
X ∼ B( 2 )
BSC(p)
(Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve) observe the realizations of correlated random variables (RV’s). The legitimate
users, who can exchange messages over a public channel, aim
at extracting a common secret key from their observations. The
rules by which the legitimate users compute the messages they
exchange over the public channel and agree on a key deﬁne a
key-distillation strategy. The maximum number of secret-key
bits per observed realization of the RV’s is called the secretkey capacity [1].
Closed-form expressions of the secret-key capacity have
been established for a large variety of models [1][3]. In
general, however, they do not provide direct insight into the
design of practical key-distillation strategies achieving the
secret-key capacity since the proofs handle reliability (the
legitimate users must share the same key) and secrecy (the
key must be unknown to the eavesdropper) concurrently.
For practical key-distillation, as in quantum key distribution [4] or wireless secure communication [5], a sequential
key-distillation strategy is often used. Such a strategy consists
of two phases that handle reliability and secrecy successively,
instead of simultaneously. A reconciliation phase [6] is ﬁrst
performed, during which Alice and Bob communicate over
the public channel to agree on a common bit sequence, that
might not be totally hidden from Eve. Then, a privacy ampliﬁcation phase [7][8] is performed, during which Alice and
Bob apply a deterministic function to their shared sequence
to generate their common secret key, this time completely
unknown from Eve. The main advantage of sequential keydistillation strategies is to provide a practical key-distillation

II. P ROBLEM S TATEMENT
As illustrated in Figure 1, a source model for secretkey agreement represents a situation in which two legitimate

1

users, Alice and Bob, and one eavesdropper, Eve, observe the
components, X, Y , and Z, of a discrete memoryless source
(DMS) (X YZ, pXY Z ), respectively. The DMS is assumed to
be outside the control of all parties, but its statistics are known.
We assume a one-way communication over an authenticated
noiseless public channel with limited rate Rp . We suppose
that Alice is the one who sends messages,1 and that she is
allowed to randomize her messages, i.e. she has access to
a source of local randomness. In addition, we suppose that
X, Y , and Z form a Markov chain – common examples
for which this hypothesis is valid, are sources generated over
the degraded broadcast channel, or over channels such that
pXZ|Y = pX|Y pZ|Y , as in a wireless context for instance.
Assuming a key alphabet K of size 2nR , the protocol deﬁned
by the three following steps is called a (2nR , n, Rp ) keydistillation strategy [1], and it will be denoted by Sn .
1) Alice observes n realizations of the source X n while Bob
observes Y n ;
2) Alice generates a realization RX of her source of local
randomness and transmits A(X n , RX ), under the restriction H(A) nRp ;
3) Alice computes K(X n , RX ) ∈ K while Bob computes
ˆ
K(Y n , A) ∈ K.
The performance of a key-distillation strategy Sn is measured
in terms of the average probability of error between the key K
ˆ
generated by Alice and the key K generated by Bob Pe (Sn )
ˆ
P[K = K|Sn ], in terms of the information leakage to the
eavesdropper L(Sn )

uniformity of the keys U(Sn ) log 2nR − H(K|Sn ).

are achievable with sequential secret-key distillation strategies
that consist of a reconciliation protocol and privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors (or hash functions).
Theorem 2 means that we can handle reliability and secrecy
successively; reconciliation deals with reliability, whereas privacy ampliﬁcation deals with secrecy.
Our main result, presented in Section III-C, is similar to
Theorem 2 for ﬁnite Rp , i.e any secret-key rate below Cs (Rp )
(Theorem 1) is achievable by a sequential key-distillation
strategy consisting of one-way rate-limited reconciliation and
privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors.
III. S EQUENTIAL KEY- DISTILLATION STRATEGY
Before we show the main result in Section III-C, we
determine the reconciliation capacity in Section III-A and we
review privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors in Section III-B.
A. Reconciliation
Deﬁnition 2. Let Rp ∈ R+ . A one-way rate-limited reconciliation protocol Rn (Rp ), noted Rn for convenience, for a
source model with DMS (X Y, pXY ) consists of
• an alphabet S = 1, M ;
• a source of local randomness (R, pR ) for Alice;
n
• an encoding function f : X × R → A;
: X n × R → S and ηb : Y n × A → S;
• two functions ηa
and operates as follows
n
• Alice observes n realizations of the source X while Bob
observes Y n ;
• Alice generates a realization RX of her source of local
randomness and transmits A = f (X n , RX ), under the
restriction H(A) nRp ;
n
• Alice computes S = ηa (X , RX ) while Bob computes
ˆ
S = ηb (Y n , A).

Deﬁnition 1. A secret-key rate R is achievable for a source
model if there exists a sequence of (2nR , n, Rp ) key-distillation
strategies {Sn }n 1 such that
lim Pe (Sn ) = 0

(reliability),

lim L(Sn ) = 0

(strong secrecy),

lim U(Sn ) = 0

(strong uniformity).

n→∞

The reliability performance of a reconciliation protocol
is measured in terms of the average probability of error
ˆ
Pe (Rn )
P[S = S|Rn ]. In addition, since the common
sequence S generated by a reconciliation protocol is followed
by a privacy ampliﬁcation step, the protocol should leak as
little information as possible over the public channel. As
in [11] we deﬁne the reconciliation rate of a reconciliation
protocol as
1
R(Rn ) n [H(S) − H(A)] .

Moreover, the supremum of such a rate R is called the secretkey capacity.
We ﬁrst recall known results regarding this model.
Theorem 1 ([3],[12]). Let (X YZ, pXY Z ) be a DMS. Let Rp
be the rate of the public channel. If X → Y → Z forms a
Markov chain, then the secret-key capacity Cs (Rp ) is

Deﬁnition 3. For a given Rp , a reconciliation rate R is
achievable, if there exists a sequence of one-way rate-limited
reconciliation protocols {Rn }n 1 such that

Cs (Rp ) = max [I(Y ; U ) − I(Z; U )]

Moreover, the supremum of such a rate R is called the

Rp = +∞. Then all secret-key rates Rs that satisfy

Proposition 1. The reconciliation capacity Crec (Rp ) is

Remark Reconciliation is closely related to common randomness [2]. Although achievability proofs are similar, converse
parts differ because the metrics optimized are different.
B. Privacy ampliﬁcation
During the privacy ampliﬁcation phase, Alice and Bob
generate their secret key by applying a deterministic function,
on which they publicly agreed ahead of time, to their common
sequence obtained after reconciliation. This phase will be
performed with extractors [14], which are functions that take
as input a sequence of n arbitrarily distributed bits and output a
sequence of k nearly uniformly distributed bits, using another
input of d truly uniformly distributed bits. The following
theorem provides a lower bound on the size of the key, on
which the legitimate users agree.

let E be the RV that represents the total knowledge about S
available to Eve. Let e be a particular realization of E. If Alice
and Bob know the conditional min-entropy H∞ (S|E = e)

C. Sequential key-distillation strategy

In this section, we prove that the combination of reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation is an optimal one-way ratelimited secret-key distillation strategy.

where (f ) holds by Fano’s inequality, and (g) holds since the
Yi ’s are i.i.d.
It is reassuring to note that Crec (Rp ) I(X; Y ) by the data
processing inequality. Note that randomization of Alice’s messages is unnecessary to achieve the reconciliation capacity. Observe also that, if Rp = +∞ and U = X in Proposition 1, we
re-obtain the result in [11], i.e. Crec (Rp = +∞) = I(X; Y ).
Moreover, Crec (Rp ) = I(X; Y ) for any Rp > H(X|Y ),
meaning that all results in [11] for the case Rp = +∞, are in
fact still valid if Rp > H(X|Y ).

Remark Privacy ampliﬁcation can be performed with hash
functions, but their use requires more random bits than extractors; indeed, a hash function needs to be chosen at random in
universal families, which requires in the order of n random
bits (see [7][11] for further details).

Note that, the size d of the uniformly distributed input
sequence is negligible, compared to the size n of the input
sequence S, so that the effect on the rate of public communication is negligible. Moreover, extractors that extract almost the
entire min-entropy of the input S and require comparatively
negligible amount of uniform randomness can be efﬁciently
constructed [14].

Note that, if we take U = X and Rp = +∞ in Theorem 4,
we re-obtain the secret-key capacity Cs (+∞) = I(X; Y ) −
I(X; Z) seen in Theorem 2. More precisely, we obtain a result
similar to the one in Section III-A for reconciliation, that is,
if Rp is at least H(X|Y ), then Cs (Rp ) = Cs (+∞).
Theorem 4 states that the sequential application of one-way
rate-limited reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation with extractors, leads to an optimal key-distillation strategy. However,
an optimal reconciliation in the sense of Proposition 1, may
not lead to an optimal sequential distillation, since the RV
U that achieves Crec (Rp ) in Proposition 1 might actually not
achieve Cs (Rp ) in Theorem 1. In the next section, we study the
binary case, for which optimal reconciliation leads to optimal
sequential key distillation.
IV. B INARY EXAMPLE
As depicted in Figure 2, assume that X has a Bernoulli
1
distribution with parameter 2 , and that X and Y (respectively
Y and Z) are connected by a binary symmetric channel (BSC)
with crossover probability p (respectively q).
Proposition 2. The reconciliation capacity and the secret-key
capacity are
1 − Hb (p β0 ), if Rp H(X|Y ),
Crec (Rp ) =
1 − Hb (p),
if Rp H(X|Y ),
Hb (p β0 q) − Hb (p β0 ), if Rp
Hb (p q) − Hb (p),
if Rp

0.1

Proof: Crec is obtained with Mrs Gerber’s Lemma [16].
The converse for Cs is more involved, it relies on the maximum
principle and the notion of supporting hyperplane [17], the
proof is not detailed because of space constraint.
Proposition 2 means that if we choose U binary and
connected by a BSC to X, then we achieve Crec (Rp ), as well
as Cs (Rp ), so that by Proposition 1 and Theorem 4, optimal
reconciliation leads to optimal sequential key distillation, i.e.
reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation are independent.
