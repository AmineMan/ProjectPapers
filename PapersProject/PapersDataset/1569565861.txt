In [1], the authors showed that the new class of NBcluster-LDPC codes does not suffer from the same limitations.
Precisely, it has been proven that the minimum distance of
ultra-sparse cluster codes grows linearly with the code length,
provided that the minimum distance of the component code,
which deﬁnes the generalized parity-checks, is above the
second eigenvalue of the graph. Using the Gilbert-Varshamov
bound on the minimum distance and the Friedman theorem [9]
on the second eigenvalue of regular graphs, it has been
shown that there exist ensembles of ultra-sparse cluster codes
with linear growing minimum distance. However, for these
ensembles the size of clusters could be far too large for
practical applications.
This work continues the research begun in our previous
work [1]. We derive a new lower bound on the minimum
distance of cluster-codes that is based on the topological, rather
than algebraic, properties of the underlying bipartite graph.
Although the bound we propose is sublinear in the code length,
it has the advantage of being applicable to any code length and
cluster sizes, and it also allows deriving a methodology for the
design of ﬁnite length cluster codes. In a second part of the paper, we also present an analysis of the asymptotic performance
of cluster codes in terms of EXIT curves. By using the area
theorem [10], we derive an upper bound on the MAP threshold,
which is conjunctured to be tight in quite general settings,
especially for codes deﬁned by regular graphs. It is shown
that the MAP thresholds of NB-cluster-LDPC codes increases
with p, and quickly approaches the Shannon limit. Finally,
we propose an optimization procedure for ﬁnite length codes,
which allows designing NB-cluster-LDPC codes with large
minimum distance, while preserving the constraint of ultrasparse Tanner graphs. The performance of the designed codes
is assessed by Monte-Carlo simulation, which demonstrates
the excellent performance of our codes under iterative BeliefPropagation decoding, on both the waterfall and the error-ﬂoor
region.

Abstract—This paper continues a previous work on non-binary
cluster-LDPC codes. Such codes are deﬁned by locally dense
parity-check matrices, with (possibly rectangular) dense clusters
of bits, but which are cluster-wise sparse. We derive a lower
bound on the minimum distance of non-binary cluster-LDPC
codes that is based on the topological properties of the underlying
bipartite graph. We also propose an optimization procedure,
which allows designing ﬁnite length codes with large minimum
distance, even in the extreme case of codes deﬁned by ultra-sparse
graphs, i.e. graphs with all symbol-nodes of degree dv = 2.
Furthermore, we provide asymptotic thresholds of ensembles
of non-binary cluster-LDPC codes, which are computed exactly
under the Belief Propagation decoding, and upper-bounded
under the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoding. We show that
the MAP-threshold upper bounds, which are conjunctured to be
tight, quickly approach the channel capacity, which conﬁrms
the excellent minimal distance properties of non-binary clusterLDPC codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper we consider a very general construction of
non-binary low-density codes, known as non-binary clusterLDPC (NB-cluster-LDPC) codes [1]. The sparse parity check
matrix H is organized in clusters of bits, where each cluster is
either a full-rank or a zero p × r binary matrix determined by
p consecutive rows and r consecutive columns of H. The case
p = r corresponds to the family of non-binary LDPC codes
deﬁned over general linear groups [2], while the case p > r
corresponds to the more general codes studied in this paper.
This type of codes has been ﬁrst introduced in [3], in the case
of general ensemble of irregular graphs, and can be seen as a
non-binary generalization of the GLD codes proposed in [4].
The case of codes for which the underlying bipartite graph
is ultra-sparse, meaning that each symbol node is connected to
exactly dv = 2 linear-constraint nodes, is of particular interest.
First, very large girths can be obtained for Tanner graphs with
dv = 2, as demonstrated in [5], [6]. It has also been pointed out
[3], [7] that when the size of the non-binary alphabet grows,
the best decoding thresholds are obtained for average density
of edges closer and closer to dv = 2. Practically, for NB codes
deﬁned over ﬁnite ﬁelds Fq with q ≥ 64, the best codes, both
asymptotically and at ﬁnite lengths, are ultra-sparse codes.
Despite those advantages, ultra-sparse LDPC codes over ﬁnite
ﬁelds or general linear groups suffer from a serious drawback,
as their minimum distance is limited and grows at best as
O(log(N )), where N is the number of symbol nodes [8].

II. N ON - BINARY CLUSTER -LDPC CODES
A NB-cluster-LDPC code is deﬁned by the structure of
its binary parity-check matrix Hbin , which is organized in
dense clusters of bits, but which is globally cluster-wise
sparse. We consider two sequences of integers {pi }i=1,...,M
and {rj }j=1,...,N that deﬁne the clustering of the parity-check
matrix Hbin = (hi,j )i = 1, . . . , M . Each cluster hi,j is a binary
j = 1, . . . , N
matrix of size pi × rj , which is either all-zero or full-rank.

We further assume that for any full-rank cluster hi,j , we have
rj ≤ pi . We note that the binary parity check matrix Hbin is of
M
N
size Mbin ×Nbin , where Mbin = i=1 pi and Nbin = j=1 rj .
The parameter Nbin will be referred to as the binary length of
the NB-cluster-LDPC code.
A codeword X = (X1 , . . . , XN ) is a sequence of
r
binary vectors Xj ∈ F2j , verifying the linear system
N
j=1 hi,j Xj = 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , M . We shall also refer to
Xj as the j th coded symbol. From a non-binary perspective, the ith non-binary linear constraint of the above system
corresponds to pi binary parity-checks, while the j th nonbinary coded symbol Xj corresponds to rj coded bits. Under
these settings, each non-zero cluster gives an injective linear
r
transformation hi,j : F2j → Fpi , from the alphabet of the
2
th
j coded symbol to the vector-space of the ith non-binary
constraint.
Let {hi,jk }k=1,...,d be the non-zero clusters in the ith nonbinary linear constraint. They form a binary code Ci with
d
length
k=1 rjk bits and co-dimension pi . Throughout the
paper, this binary code will be referred to as the ith component
c
code; hence, Ci is the kernel of the binary matrix Hi :

use the notation from the previous section, and we also denote
by (hi,j ) the image of the linear application:
r

hi,j : F2j → Fpi
2
Since hi,j is injective, (hi,j ) ⊆ Fpi is a vector subspace of
2
dimension rj .
The following theorem provides a lower bound on the minimum distance ∆ of the NB-cluster-LDPC code, depending
on the girth g of its Tanner graph, namely the length of its
shortest cycle.
Theorem 1: Assume that (hi,j ) ∩ (hi,j ) = {0} for any
two edges i ∼ j and i ∼ j , adjacent to the same constraint
node i. Then:
g
∆ ≥ 2 4 +2 − 3,
where g is the girth of the bipartite graph Γ, and x denotes
the largest integer strictly less than x (thus, x = x − 1 if x
is integer, and x = x otherwise).
Proof. Let X = (X1 , . . . , XN ) be a non-zero codeword, where
r
Xj = (xj,1 , . . . , xj,rj ) ∈ F2j . Let j0 be an active symbol node,
meaning that Xj0 contains a non-zero bit, and let V be the set
of nodes at topological distance from j0 . Thus, V0 = {j0 },
V1 is the set of constraint-nodes connected to j0 , V2 is the
set of symbol-nodes connected to j0 by a path of length 2,
etc. Assume that is odd and < g/2. Then any constraint
node i ∈ V is connected to a unique symbol node belonging to
V −1 and to dc − 1 symbol nodes belonging to V +1 . Consider
i ∈ V , such that its parent symbol node j ∈ V −1 is active
(i.e. Xj contains a non-zero bit). Since X veriﬁes the linear
constraint corresponding to i, we have:

c
Hi = [hi,j1 hi,j2 · · · hi,jd ]
c
c
Note also that two component matrices Hi1 and Hi2 might
be equal, possibly after some column or row permutation, even
if the number and the size of non-zero clusters participating
in the non-binary constraints i1 and i2 are different. Put
c
c
differently, the same component matrix Hi1 = Hi2 can be
clusterized in different manners.
The non-binary nature of NB-cluster-LDPC codes is better
highlighted through their graphical representation. The bipartite (Tanner) graph Γ, associated with the NB-cluster-LDPC
code, consists of N symbol-nodes and M constraint nodes,
which are connected according to the non-zero clusters hi,j .
The j th symbol-node represents a plurality of rj coded bits,
while the ith constraint-node represents a plurality of pi binary
parity-checks. The nodes are connected by an edge if and only
if the cluster hi,j is non-zero, in which case the corresponding
edge is considered as being labeled by hi,j . The labels on the
edges correspond to the generalization of the non-zero ﬁeld
values for usual NB-LDPC codes [11].
The Belief Propagation (BP) decoder for NB-cluster-LDPC
codes is similar to the one for usual NB-LDPC codes on Galois
ﬁelds [7], [12], and is based on local Bayesian update rules
following the non-binary constraints structure. As a consequence, BP decoding can be performed in the Fourier domain
to speed-up the simulations [11], and the low complexity
decoders proposed for NB-LDPC codes [13], [14] can be
easily extended to NB-cluster-LDPC codes.

hi,j Xj = 0
j=j ∼i

On the other hand, (hi,j ) ∩ (hi,j ) = {0}, for any j = j.
From the above equation, it follows that at least two children
symbol nodes (j , j ) ∈ V +1 have to be active. Since there
are no cycles of length < g, the minimum distance is lower
bounded by the number of active-symbol nodes at distance
< g/2, with even, which is given by:

if the bipartite graph Γ is constructed by using the Progressive

Proof. Follows from the above theorem and from [15, Theorem1] that states a lower bound on the girth of regular bipartite
graphs built by the PEG algorithm.
The Theorem 1 provides a lower bound on the minimum
distance of NB-cluster-LDPC codes, under the assumption that
the labels hi,j of the edges incident to a constraint node
i = 1, . . . , M have pairwise disjoint images. If such an

NB-cluster-LDPC codes. We only consider NB-cluster-LDPC
codes deﬁned by regular (dv = 2, dc ) graphs, which represents
the most problematic case in terms of minimum distance. We

the last one being equivalent to the Maximum Likelihood
decoding over the BEC).
For given code length Nbin and channel erasure probability
ε, we denote by hNbin (ε) the probability that a bit remains
erased after decoding, assuming that the received value (if any)
of this particular bit has not been submitted to the decoder.
The EXIT function h(ε) is deﬁned as the (pointwise) limit of
hNbin (ε), when the code length Nbin goes to inﬁnity. The BP
and MAP thresholds of E(λ, ρ, r, p) are given by:

assumption is met, then for each constraint node i, the images
of the labels of the incident edges j ∼ i deﬁne dc vector
subspaces { (hi,j )}j∼i of Fpi , of dimensions {rj }j∼i , which
2
are pairwise disjoint. Conversely, if for each constraint node
i there exist dc pairwise disjoint vector subspaces of Fpi , of
2
dimensions {rj }j∼i , then it is possible to label the edges of
Γ, so that the assumption of Theorem 1 is met.
In order to verify the efﬁciency of this constraint, and then
have an indication whether the lower bound of Theorem 1 is
tight or not, let us denote by d(r, p) the maximum number
of pairwise disjoint vector subspaces of Fp , for some given
2
cluster dimension r ≤ p. Clearly, d(1, p) = 2p − 1 and
p
< r ≤ p. Moreover, for any
d(r, p) = 1 for any

= sup{ε ∈ [0, 1] | hBP (ε) = 0},
= sup{ε ∈ [0, 1] | hMAP (ε) = 0},

where subscripts BP and MAP are used to indicate the
decoding algorithm.
Explicit formulae for the computation of the BP-EXIT curve
can be derived by using density evolution (DE) techniques,
similar to those presented in [17]. We have derived DE
equations for NB-cluster-LDPC codes, however, due to space
limitation they are not presented here, but will be included in
an extended version of this paper. The exact computation of the
MAP-EXIT function is generally unworkable. However, using
1
the area theorem [10], we have
hMAP (ε) dε = R, where
MAP
R is the designed coding rate of the given ensemble. Moreover,
since the BP decoding is suboptimal with respect to the MAP
decoding, we have hBP (ε) ≥ hMAP (ε). Hence, if for some
1
¯MAP , ¯ hBP (ε) dε = R, we necessarily have ¯MAP ≥ MAP .
MAP
This gives an upper bound on the MAP-threshold, which is
known to be tight in the binary case [10].
Table II shows the BP thresholds and the MAP threshold
upper bounds for various ensembles of ultra-sparse cluster
codes with designed code rate R = 1/2. Parameters r and
p are shown in the table, λ = x (corresponding to dv = 2),
while ρ is determined, “as regular as possible”, according
to parameters λ, r, p, and R. We can observe that for both
r = 1 and r = 2, the BP threshold value increases with p for
r ≤ p ≤ 4, and it starts decreasing from this point. This can
be explained as follows. By increasing the value of p, we also
increase the check-node degree (dv = 2 and R = 1/2, hence
dc = 4 p ). Consequently, component codes become longer
r
and the expected value of the number of erased bits on each
component code increases. If the expected value of the number
of erased bits on component codes increases faster than their
minimal distance, the iterative decoding is penalized, due to
the fact that each component code is affected by too many
erased bits.
As we can observe, the upper bound of the MAP threshold
increases with p and quickly approaches the Shannon limit,
which shows that the NB-cluster-LDPC codes ensembles are
good both for iterative decoding and MLD decoding.

The proof is omitted due to space limitation. Now, consider
a NB-cluster-LDPC code, and for each constraint node i,
let ri = maxj∼i rj ≤ pi be the maximum dimension of
¯
its neighbor symbol nodes. If dc ≤ d(¯i , pi ), ∀i, then for
r
each constraint node i there exist dc pairwise disjoint vector
subspaces of Fpi , of dimension ri . Since ri ≥ rj , ∀j ∼ i, it
¯

follows that it is possible to label the edges of Γ, so that the
assumption of Theorem 1 is met, and provides a useful tool for
NB-cluster-LDPC code design with good minimum distance.
As an example, we give in Table I a set of 16 clusters of
size (p = 8, r = 4) with pairwise disjoint images, obtained
by selecting columns from the (Nbin = 128, Kbin = 120)
extended-Hamming code with minimum distance 4. Note that
the maximum number of clusters indicated by equation (1) is
d(4, 8) ≤ 17.
IV. BP AND MAP THRESHOLDS OVER THE BEC
Throughout this section, we assume that the transmission
takes place over a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC). We consider
the ensemble of cluster codes E(λ, ρ, r, p), where λ and ρ
denote the edge-perspective degree distribution polynomials of
the subjacent bipartite graph, each graph edge corresponding
to a full-rank cluster of size p × r (p ≥ r) in the binary paritycheck matrix of the code.
EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) curves were ﬁrst
introduced in [16] as a technique to analyse the convergence
of the iterative decoding process of parallel concatenated
codes. A more general deﬁnition has been introduced in [10],
where the EXIT curve is associated with the sparse graph
system rather than the component (concatenated) codes. The
advantage of this approach is that it allows deﬁning EXIT
curves for any decoding algorithm (e.g. IT or MAP decoding,

We propose in this section an optimization procedure which
designs NB-cluster-LDPC codes with large minimum distance,
while preserving the constraint of ultra-sparse Tanner graphs

target coding rate R . We also assume that the clusters have
constant number of rows (p∗ , . . . , p∗ ) = (p∗ , . . . , p∗ ), while

their number of columns might be different (r1 , . . . , rN ), and
not ﬁxed a priori, as long as the constraint on the codeword
∗
∗
length i ri = Nbin is veriﬁed.
As indicated by [1, Theorem 1], good NB-cluster-LDPC
codes should have bipartite graph with the smallest possible
second eigenvalue λ2 (Γ), and component codes Ci with the
largest possible minimum distance δ. Following [1], we refer
to δ as the local minimum distance of the NB-cluster-LDPC
code. One possible way of designing a NB-cluster-LDPC code
with a given local minimum distance δ is by considering a
linear code C of length d, dimension (d − p), and minimum
distance δ, and labeling the edges incident to each constraint
node of Γ by an appropriate clustering of a parity-check matrix
H c of C.
In order to differentiate the structure of the clusters from
one constraint node to another, a simple procedure consists in
performing a random permutation of the columns of H c . The
permutation is chosen such as to obtain clusters with full rank,
which is possible only if the local minimum distance of the
∗
component code is large enough: δ ≥ mini (ri ).
We moreover advise to follow the guidelines of Theorem 1
and form the clusters such that they have pairwise disjoint
images. This constraint, together with the minimization of
λ2 (Γ) and the maximization of δ, form the main guidelines of
the ﬁrst step of the proposed optimized code design algorithm.
The principle of the optimization is to start from a NB(0)

than the ones of the target code. The ﬁrst step of optimization
(0)
is then to build Hbin with the above mentioned guidelines.
Then the construction algorithm performs an iterative shortening of the code by removing columns of the binary paritycheck matrix, with the goal of increasing monotonically the
minimum distance at each iteration of shortening. At each
iteration k, we make use of the improved impulse algorithm
(k)
[18] to identify low Hamming weight codewords of Hbin , and
kill them in order to ensure by this careful design that the
obtained NB-cluster-LDPC has a large minimum distance. We
proceed in an iterative fashion as summarized in Algorithm 1

described below.
Let us discuss ﬁrst the proposed initialization steps. For the
step (a) we construct several graphs Γ by using the modiﬁed
Random-PEG algorithm [6], which is able to design minimum
size graphs for dv = 2 and a given girth g. We then choose
a graph Γ with minimum second eigenvalue. For the step (b),
we choose a component code H c with the highest possible
local minimum distance from existing codes in the literature
[19]. Finally, the step (c) consists in selecting columns of H c
such as to build clusters with pairwise disjoint images. An
efﬁcient implementation of this step is to select at random the
clusters from a pre-determined set of clusters with pairwise
disjoint images, as the set given on Table I for clusters of
sizes (p = 8, r = 4).
We now discuss the details of the iterative shortening
procedure, which relies heavily on the ability to identify lowweight codewords of a sparse linear code. We have adapted
the “improved impulse method” algorithm proposed in [18] to
NB-cluster-LDPC codes. This algorithm ﬁnds the low-weight
codewords of sparse linear codes, and was proved to be largely
more efﬁcient than other techniques on benchmark LDPC
codes. The iterative shortening process ensures that the ﬁnal
NB-cluster-LDPC code has no codeword of Hamming weights
much smaller than its typical expected minimum distance.
We give in Table III an example of the iterative shortening
∗
process, for the case of Nbin = 256 and R∗ = 1/2. The initial
(0)
code deﬁned by the parity check matrix Hbin is built from a
(0)
(dv = 2, dc = 16) graph with rate R = 0.75 and clusters of
sizes (p, r(0) ) = (8, 4) taken at random from the Table I. We
(k)
indicate at each step the code rate and length of Hbin , as well
as the low weight spectrum computed with the improved impulse method. The successive 7 steps of shortening gradually
improve the low weight spectrum, as the code rate decreases
from R(0) = 0.75 to R(7) = R∗ = 0.5, reaching a ﬁnal NB-

cluster-LDPC code with minimum distance ∆ = 23, which
is a good value considering that the NB-cluster-LDPC code
is based on an ultra-sparse Tanner graph with girth g = 8.
Note that a direct design with only the initialization step and
no shortening procedure gave a NB-cluster-LDPC code with
minimum distance ∆ = 20.
The optimization algorithm presented in this section should
be used only to design NB-cluster-LDPC codes at short to
moderate codeword lengths. For long codes the iterative short∗
ening steps become cumbersome, and for Nbin > 2000 the NBcluster-LDPC code design is limited at the initialization step
of the optimization algorithm, and other reﬁnement techniques
need to be used without relying on the knowledge of low
weight codewords.

VI. N UMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, the performance of NB-cluster-LDPC codes
is assessed through Monte-Carlo simulation over the BinaryInput AWGN channel. In Figure 1, we show the comparison
of regular binary LDPC codes from [20], and two NB-clusterLDPC codes with p∗ = 8, optimized with Algorithm 1. The BP
decoding performs a maximum of 100 iterations and it stops
when a valid codeword is found by syndrome computation.
As expected, the NB-cluster-LDPC codes combine the two
advantages of having good performance in the waterfall region
due to the sparse representation of their Tanner graphs, as
well as larger minimum distance than other classes of codes.
Since it has been shown in [8] that the error ﬂoor of ultrasparse non-binary LDPC codes with dv = 2 comes from
low-weight codewords and not from the presence of the socalled pseudo-codewords, the large minimum-distance of NBcluster-LDPC codes also determines very good performance in
the error ﬂoor region. NB-cluster-LDPC codes did not show
any error ﬂoor until FER = 10−8 , which, coupled with the
waterfall performance, is a very good and unpreceding result
for iteratively decodable codes at short block-lengths.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we derived a lower bound on the minimum
distance of ultra-sparse NB-cluster-LDPC codes, and provided
asymptotic thresholds for the BP and MAP decoders. We
also proposed a construction of ﬁnite-length codes with large
minimum distances, and we showed that the constructed codes
exhibit very good performance under BP decoding on both the
waterfall and the error-ﬂoor region.
