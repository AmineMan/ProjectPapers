Bidirectional Channel Estimation Using Adaptive
Pilots
Fei Teng, Dongning Guo and Michael L. Honig

they are not intended to be accurate. Rather, the simple models
allow a simple analysis to illustrate the potential beneﬁts of
adapting pilots for channels where reciprocity applies.
The bidirectional estimation strategy studied in this paper
is motivated in part by the bidirectional training schemes
proposed in [1] and [2]. There the users take turns transmitting
pilots in each direction to estimate beamformers and receive
ﬁlters directly. Two-way training schemes for estimating CSI
at one end were previously presented in [3], [4], [5], [6]. In [7],
multiple round protocols implemented by power control could
achieve a diversity-multiplexity tradeoff. A very recent paper
[8] studies simply combining training and quantized feedback
to acquire CSI at transmitter in a TDD system.
The bidirectional channels studied in this paper resemble
the two-way channels studied by Shannon [9] and subsequent
authors [10], [11]. That work, however, has mainly been
concerned with the capacity trade-off between the two users
instead of the problem of estimating some common channel
state.

Abstract—Two users at the two ends of a bidirectional channel
wish to estimate the common state of the channel. The problem
is usually treated as two separate one-way channel estimation
problems: User 1 sends deterministic pilots to assist user 2 in
estimating the channel, and vice versa. This paper questions
whether such separation is optimal. In other words, is it beneﬁcial
to let a user choose pilots that adapt to what the user has
learned about the channel? Two concrete models are studied and
it is found that using adaptive pilots often improves the channel
estimate. In the special case of a Gaussian channel with colored
additive interference, an iterative bidirectional estimation scheme
is proposed, which achieves signiﬁcantly better performance than
separate one-way estimation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Many communication channels are bidirectional, where
two users exchange information through the same physical
medium. Oftentimes, both users wish to acquire some common
channel state information (CSI), such as the gain of a timedivision duplex (TDD) fading channel. This bidirectional
channel estimation problem is conventionally divided into two
one-way estimation problems, where, in each direction, the
sender transmits deterministic pilots to assist the receiver.
This paper poses some fundamental questions: Is it optimal
to separate the bidirectional channel estimation problem into
two one-way problems? Can a user adapt its signaling to the
information already acquired to better assist the other user?
To answer these questions in a novel view, we study two
concrete models. The ﬁrst model involves a bidirectional channel where the common multiplicative channel coefﬁcient takes
two possible values. It is shown in a simple case that a smaller
probability of estimation error is achievable at one user by
using adaptive pilots than using predetermined (deterministic)
pilots from the other user. The second model is a bidirectional
Gaussian channel where both users are subjected to a common
colored interference. The goal is for each user to estimate the
common interference by linearly ﬁltering its received signals.
To assist the other user, each user applies a scaling of the most
recent received symbol as the adaptive pilot. With optimized
scaling and linear estimators, the mean square error (MSE)
achieved by the bidirectional estimation scheme is shown to
be substantially smaller than that achieved by separate oneway estimation. Although the preceding models are motivated
by two-way wireless channels with fading and/or interference,

II. A FADING C HANNEL E STIMATION P ROBLEM
In this section, we use a simple model to demonstrate
that treating a bidirectional channel estimation problem as
two separate one-way estimation problems is in general not
optimal. The model involves two users communicating through
a bidirectional discrete-time half-duplex fading channel with
complex-valued state H. When user 1 transmits signal Xt
during symbol interval t, user 2 receives
Yt = HXt + Nt

(1)

and when user 2 transmits signal Xτ during symbol interval
τ , user 1 receives
Yτ = HXτ + Nτ

(2)

where {Nτ } and {Nt } are independent noise processes consisting of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) standard circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) random
variables. It is assumed that both users are subject to average
transmit power constraint. Evidently, if only user 1 wishes to
estimate the channel coefﬁcient H, it is optimal to let user
2 transmit a constant symbol. If both users wish to estimate
the channel, it is usually treated as two separate estimation
problems: The two users take turns to transmit constant pilots
to assist the other user to estimate the channel.
Does it help to adapt the pilot to one’s knowledge about
the channel? To answer this question, consider a special case

where H is equally likely to be 1 and j = ej 2 . If user 1
sends constant 1, then user 2 receives Yt = H + Nt , so that
to estimate H is to test between two hypotheses 1 and j in
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The square distance
(per symbol) between the two hypotheses is |1 − j|2 = 2,
which determines the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Suppose for
a moment user 1 knows H (or has perfect estimate), so that
user 1 can send H itself as the pilot. Then user 2 receives
Yt = H 2 + Nt , where H · H = H 2 is equally likely to be
±1. User 2 still carries out hypothesis testing, whereas the
SNR doubles because the square distance between the two
hypotheses increases to 4.
It is, however, not always beneﬁcial to use adaptive pilots.
For example, if H in (1) and (2) is equally likely to be 0 and
1, then it is optimal to transmit constant pilots, because using
adaptive pilots does not improve the average square distance
between the two hypotheses.
If a user’s knowledge about the channel state is imprecise,
is it still beneﬁcial to use adaptive pilots? We answer this
question by assuming two channel uses only, one by each
user, with maximum signal power s2 . Let user 1 send a pilot
symbol s so that user 2 estimates the channel by testing the two
hypotheses s and js. The error probability of user 2 is Pe =

Suppose user 2 next sends X = s if H = 1; otherwise
user 2 sends X = sejθ for some θ ∈ [0, π) to be optimized
shortly. Then signal HX takes four possible values depending

four points are symmetric about line OB. The optimal decision
rule is simple: If the received signal Y of user 1 falls to the

where1 β ∈ (0, 1].2 The processes {Nt }, {Nt } and {Ht } are
independent. Assume that both users are subject to maximum
amplitude constraint: |Xt | ≤ smax and |Xt | ≤ smax for all t.
We shall consider both full- and half-duplex modes of the
channel. The full-duplex mode models the situation where
the users simultaneously inject two symbols Xt and Xt at
the two ends of the channel during interval t and receive
Yt and Yt , respectively. The interference Ht to both users is
identical, while the noise components Nt and Nt are different,
because they are introduced at the respective receiving ends.
The physical model suggests that the received signal should
also contain one’s own transmitted signal. Such (known) selfinterference is assumed to be canceled to yield (5) and (6).

Let the correlation coefﬁcient of any two random variables
U and V be denoted by ρ(U, V ). The minimum MSE at time
t achieved by any linear estimation is expressed as:

The half-duplex mode models the situation where a user
cannot receive any useful signal during its own transmission,
so that the users should not transmit at the same time. In case
of half-duplex transmission, it is further assumed that user 1
transmits during odd intervals and user 2 transmits during even
intervals in this section.
We restrict our attention to linear estimators. If all random
processes involved are Gaussian, the optimal estimator is often
linear.

Let t be an even number. From (6), we can write

We now allow users to coordinate and adapt pilots to their
respective received signals. For simplicity, we ﬁrst consider
memoryless processing. That is, the estimate of the current
interference as well as the pilot to be transmitted in the next
interval only depends on the most recent received symbol.
We assume half-duplex channel in this subsection. The
memoryless scheme is described as follows: Suppose user 2
receives Yt−1 during interval t−1, where t is an even number.
During interval t, user 2 transmits pilot

Xt+1 = at+1 Yt ,

(14)

and let st denote the standard deviation of the current pilot,
i.e., we have

in (11). Evidently, minimizing the MSE is equivalent to
maximizing the correlation coefﬁcient ρ(Yt , Ht ). That is, the
more correlated are the received signal and the interference,
the better the interference can be estimated.
We determine {at , bt } next. Since the expected value of the
pilots are inconsequential, we assume E {Xt } = E {Xt } = 0.
For convenience, we let ρt denote the correlation coefﬁcient
of the current pilot and interference:

The problem of one-way estimation in the half-duplex mode
is similar, except that one can use only every other received
symbol. The steady-state performance is the same as that
of the full-duplex mode with reduced covariance. That is,
the minimum causal MSE h is the unique positive root of
equation (9) with β replaced by β 2 .

Xt = at Yt−1 ,

ˆ
Ht − Ht

bt = E {Yt Ht }/E Yt2

We ﬁrst study the performance achieved by separate oneway channel estimation. The optimal linear estimators in the
mean-square sense can be viewed as a Kalman ﬁlter. We
ﬁrst consider the full-duplex mode. Since constant pilots are
inconsequential here, it sufﬁces to assume Xt = Xt = 0 at all
time. The received signal of user 1 is thus Yt = Ht + Nt .
In steady state, or, equivalently, when {Ht } is wide-sense
stationary, the minimum causal MSE f is the unique positive
root of the second-order polynomial equation [12]:

In the subsequent interval, user 1 transmits a pilot

All parameters can be derived sequentially as follows: At
the beginning of time t = 0, before any observation is made,
we have ρ0 = 0. Hence the optimal s0 = 0, so the pilot can
be chosen as X0 = 0 with a0 = 0 and b0 = σ 2 /(1 + σ 2 ).
In general, given ρt , we can obtain the optimal st from (23)
and subsequently determine (at , bt ) as well as ρ(Yt , Ht ). The
preceding process can be repeated in the subsequent symbol
interval, because once ρ(Yt , Ht ) is determined from (21), we
can obtain
ρt+1 = ρ(Xt+1 , Ht+1 )

Xt+1 = aYt

(27)

where a represents a (memoryless) scaling.
We ﬁrst consider the full-duplex mode in this subsection.
It sufﬁces to discuss the performance of user 1 according to
the symmetric model. For every interval t, the signals are
described by (5), (6), (35) and (36). Due to the orthogonality
condition of optimal linear ﬁltering [12], we have, for all l ≤ t

In this subsection, we seek the optimal linear causal estimation at the receivers assuming that the pilots are still generated
using the most recent received symbol in a memoryless
manner. We study the steady-state performance for brevity. It
is enough to assume that all pilot and received signal processes
are deﬁned for all integer values of time t and stationary.

The case of full-duplex memoryless bidirectional estimation

The performance of memoryless bidirectional estimation is
demonstrated by simulation results at the end of this section.

that despite memoryless processing at each end, the bidirectional scheme introduces memory into the overall estimation
procedure. Moreover, in the half-duplex mode, the one-way
estimation only has access to every other output symbol,
