Abstract—Short message noisy network coding (SNNC) transmits independent short messages in blocks rather than using
long message repetitive encoding. SNNC is shown to achieve
the same rates as noisy network coding (NNC) for discrete
memoryless networks where each node transmits a multicast
message. One advantage of SNNC is that backward decoding may
be used which simpliﬁes the analysis and understanding of the
achievability proof. The analysis reveals that each decoder may
ignore certain other nodes rather than including their message
in the decoding procedure. Additionally, SNNC enables early
decoding at nodes if the channel quality happens to be good.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Recently, Lim et al. [1] proposed Noisy Network Coding
(NNC) for communications over noisy networks and developed a lower bound on the capacity. Their result recovers
previous results in [2]–[5] as special cases.
The paper [1] uses three techniques from [5], namely
• Relays quantize without hashing (or binning), which simpliﬁes the relay operation and is referred to as quantizeforward (QF).
• Destinations decode messages and quantization bits
jointly rather than sequentially.
• Repetitive encoding with long messages at the sources.
One drawback of long messages is that they inhibit decodeforward (DF) at the relays even if the channel conditions are
good [6]. For example, if one relay is close to the source
and has a strong source-relay link, the natural operation is DF
which removes the noise at the relay. But this is generally not
possible with a long message because of its high rate.
Fortunately, a short message variant called SNNC gives the
same rate as NNC for one unicast session [7] (see also [8]).
SNNC has:
1) Sources transmit independent short messages in every
block (see [9, Appendix D]).
2) Relays perform QF.
3) Destinations decode with backward decoding or joint
decoding or any other type of decoding.
Note that the name SNNC does not depend on what kind
of decoder is used but is a generic name for the encoding
procedure. Indeed, we will see that the choice of decoder is
important for certain problems.
The main contribution of this work is to show that SNNC
achieves the same rates as NNC for general discrete memory-

less networks (DMNs) with multiple multicast sessions. However, we will see that SNNC seems to have extra constraints
that do not appear for NNC. We show that these constraints
are redundant by using the same approach as in [8].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we state
the problem and our main result. In Section III, we present
SNNC for DMNs with multicast-sessions and show that SNNC
achieves the same rates as NNC.

Random variables are written with upper case letters and
their realizations with the corresponding lower case letters.
Bold upper and lower case letters refer to random vectors
with speciﬁed dimensions and their respective realizations.
Subscripts on a symbol denote the symbol’s source and the position of the symbol in a sequence. For instance, Xki denotes
the i-th output of the k-th encoder. Superscripts denote ﬁnitelength sequences of symbols, e.g., xn = {xk1 , . . . , xkn }. Set
k
subscripts denote vectors of letters, e.g., XS = [Xk , k ∈ S].
We use Tǫn (PX ) to denote the set of letter-typical sequences
with respect to PX .
Consider the K-Node discrete memoryless network (DMN)
depicted in Fig. 1, where each node has one message only.
Node k ∈ K, K = {1, . . . , K} has message Wk destined for
nodes in the set Dk , Dk ⊆ K, while acting as a relay for
messages of the other nodes. The messages are statistically

joint distribution that factors as

over the set {1, . . . , 2nRk }, where nRk is assumed to be an
integer. We write R(S) = k∈S Rk and D(S) = ∪k∈S Dk .

The bounds in (12) are the NNC rate bounds describing the
rates for the nodes in K \ B while treating the signals from
the nodes in B as noise. This suggests that even for NNC, if
any of the constraints is violated, the destination node should
treat the signals from the corresponding nodes as noise rather
than decoding them. In this way, we get better rates.
Now repeat the above argument for the nodes in K \B, until
we ﬁnally reach a set Kk ⊆ K, for which we have no more
violation of constraints, which means

i∈S

Therefore, (7) can be written as

RKk (B) = I(XB ; YBc Yk |XBc ) − I(YB ; YB |XKk YBc Yk )

We can split the bounds in (8) for two different kinds of
subsets S ⊂ K and B ⊂ K:
1) S : S ∩ Dk = ∅
c
2) B : B ∩ Dk = ∅ or equivalently B : B ⊆ Dk
Hence, we can rewrite the bounds in (8) as follows:

for all subsets B ⊆ (Kk \ Dk ) ⊂ Kk s.t. k ∈ B c , where B c is
now the complement set of B in Kk .
The error probability tends to zero as n → ∞ if

R(S) < RK (S)

(9)

R(S) < RKk (S)

subject to R(B) < RK (B)

(10)

for all subsets S ⊂ Kk s.t. S ∩ Dk = ∅ and k ∈ S c , where S c
is the complement set of S in Kk .
We remark that there is a subtle addition to [8] and difference to [11], namely that each k ∈ D may have a different
set Kk of nodes whose messages and quantization indices it
includes in its typicality test. But we can achieve the same rates
as in (13) at node k with SNNC using backward decoding by
treating the signals from the nodes in K \ Kk as noise. Hence
we may ignore the constraints in (10) associated with SNNC
at node k.
By the union bound, the error probability for all destinaK
tions tends to zero as n → ∞ if the rate tuple RSNNC =
(R1 , . . . , RK ) satisﬁes

for all subsets S ⊂ K s.t. S ∩ Dk = ∅ and k ∈ S c and all
c
subsets B ⊆ Dk ⊂ K s.t. k ∈ B c .
With (10), it is guaranteed that the quantization indices lj−1
for the next (backward) decoding step are reliably decoded.
Continuing this way, node k ∈ D successively decodes all
messages wj and quantization indices lj−1 , j = 1, . . . , B.
Note that for any S ⊂ K and k ∈ D s.t. k ∈ S c , we have
k ∈ S c ∩ D(S) if and only if S ∩ Dk = ∅:
1) If S ∩ Dk = ∅, there exists at least one i ∈ S s.t.
k ∈ Di ⊆ D(S) which implies that k ∈ S c ∩ D(S).
2) If k ∈ S c ∩ D(S), there exists at least one i ∈ S s.t.
k ∈ Di which implies that i ∈ Dk . We hence have
S ∩ Dk = ∅.
Hence, in [1, Theorem 2], with long-message NNC the error
probability at node k ∈ D tends to zero as n → ∞ if
R(S) < RK (S)

The difference between the SNNC and NNC bounds are
the constraints (10). If all constraints in (10) are satisﬁed, it is
obvious that SNNC achieves the same rates as NNC. In this
case the decoder should decode the signals from the nodes in

Dk , since they can be decoded with the signals from the nodes

It turns out that SNNC with joint decoding also achieves
the same rates as in (2). Recently, the authors of [12] claimed
that SNNC with joint decoding fails to achieve the NNC rates
for multi-source networks because long message repetition
encoding is needed to do so. This is not true. With a minor
modiﬁcation of the decoding procedure, namely, ﬁrst decoding
the last quantization indices and then performing joint decoding with the messages and remaining quantization bits, SNNC
with joint decoding performs as well as SNNC with backward
decoding and NNC. This makes sense, since intuitively one
would expect joint decoding to perform at least as well as
backward decoding. Due to the similarity to the proof with
backward decoding, details are omitted.

However, interesting cases arise when one of the two nodes
acts only as a relay node and the constraints kick in. Suppose
now node 2 acts as a relay node only (Fig. 2(b)), we have
ˆ
R1(SNNC) <min I(X1 ; Y2 Yd |X2 ),
ˆ
I(X1 X2 ; Yd ) − I(Y2 ; Y2 |X1 X2 Yd )

subject to I(X2 ; Yd |X1 ) − I(Y2 ; Y2 |X1 X2 Yd ) > 0

R1(NNC) <min I(X1 ; Y2 Yd |X2 ),
ˆ
I(X1 X2 ; Yd ) − I(Y2 ; Y2 |X1 X2 Yd )

(17)

Now we ask whether R1(SNNC) in (15) with the constraint (16)
is equivalent to R1(NNC) in (17). This is equivalent to asking
K
K
whether RSNNC = RNNC in point 1 and point 2 in Fig. 3. To
K
K
see this, choose R2 = ǫ, ǫ > 0, we have RSNNC = RNNC .
K
K
Let ǫ → 0, we must have RSNNC → RNNC in point 1. We
K
K
also have RSNNC → RNNC in point 2 with the same argument.
Therefore, it suggests that we might ignore the quantization
constraint in (16).
