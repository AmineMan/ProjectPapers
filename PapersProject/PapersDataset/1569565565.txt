written as a vector σ = (σ0 , . . . , σN −1 ), which represents the
output of the permutation. The distance between two elements
of SN is taken to be the Hamming distance between their
vector representations. We use the notation Zn = {0, . . . , q −
q
1}n to denote the Hamming space. A distance-preserving map
Π : Zn → SN is a mapping which preserves the Hamming
q
distance between any two vectors, that is, d(Π(x), Π(y)) ≥
d(x, y) for any vectors x, y ∈ Zn . A distance-increasing map
q
Π : Zn → SN strictly increases the Hamming distance, that is,
q
d(Π(x), Π(y)) > d(x, y) for any distinct vectors x, y ∈ Zn .
q
An upper bound on the size of a permutation code with
minimum distance d is given by N !/(d − 1)!. Clearly, the
information rate of a permutation code can be larger than the
rate achievable by DPMs from q-ary Hamming space (unless
q is proportional to N ). Sharply k-transitive groups, which
have efﬁcient decoding, are known to achieve this upper bound
(see [1], [2]). For such groups either d ≤ 3 or d ≥ N − 4.
In the latter case, the size of the code is only polynomial in
N . Thus it is of interest to consider other means of obtaining
permutation codes, for instance from DPMs.
In the following sections we consider very speciﬁc DIMs
and DPMs. All the DIMs and DPMs we use are non-length
preserving, but ensure that efﬁcient estimation algorithms
exist. Hence, the rate of the codes decreases by a factor of
1/ log2 q , compared to the q-ary code in the Hamming space.
We consider a channel, for instance the PLC channel, which
introduces both errors and erasures. The simplest such algorithm, and DIM from the binary Hamming space, introduced in
the next section has only linear complexity. This algorithm also
guarantees that the estimation procedure does not introduce
extra errors or erasures in the binary digits. The mappings in
the subsequent sections are more complicated and require at
least two symbols in the permutation space to estimate one
q-ary digit. Hence, such guarantees can be provided if the
channel introduces only erasures.

Abstract—We study the decoding of permutation codes obtained from distance preserving maps and distance increasing
maps from Hamming space. We provide efﬁcient algorithms for
estimating the q-ary digits of the Hamming space so that decoding
can be performed in the Hamming space.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Transmission of data over high voltage electric power lines
is a challenging problem due to the harsh nature of the channel.
The noise characteristics of this channel, called the powerline
communication (PLC) channel, include permanent narrowband
noise, impulse noise, in addition to fading and additive white
Guassian noise. Vinck [8] studied this channel and showed
that M -ary Frequency Shift Keying (M -FSK) modulation, in
conjunction with the use of permutation codes, provide the
required redundancy to correct the errors resulting from the
harsh noise pattern. This has given rise to increased research
on codes in the permutation space (see [4] for a survey). One
method to obtain a permutation code is to consider distance
increasing maps (DIMs) or distance preserving maps (DPMs)
from the Hamming space to the permutation space. The
works in [3], [5]–[7] address the problem of constructing such
DIMs and DPMs. Unlike the case of codes in the Hamming
space, decoding of codes in the permutation space is a more
difﬁcult problem, especially because of the loss of linearity.
Bailey [1] gave efﬁcient decoding algorithms in the case
when the permutation codes are subgroups. Unfortunately, the
permutation codes obtained from DIMs or DPMs of codes
in the Hamming space are not permutation groups in general.
Swart and Ferreira [7] studied some DIMs and DPMs from the
binary Hamming space to permutations and provided efﬁcient
decoding algorithms for determining the binary vectors.
In this work we study the problem of decoding permutation
codes obtained from DIMs or DPMs of q-ary Hamming
codes. The main idea that we employ is to perform only
estimation of the q-ary digits from the received vector. The
actual decoding of the estimated q-ary vector is performed in
the q-ary Hamming space. Decoding of linear codes is a very
well studied problem and many efﬁcient decoding algorithms
exist. Our aim here is to provide efﬁcient ways of estimating
the q-ary digits so that the overall estimation and decoding
procedure still retains low complexity.
We use the notation SN to denote the permutation space
over the symbols {0, . . . , N − 1}. Each element σ of SN is

II. DIM FROM BINARY VECTORS TO PERMUTATIONS
In this section we discuss a DIM from binary vectors to
permutations. Lee [5] studied a DIM and its properties, which
is similar to this DIM (also, [7, Eg. 1]). We give an efﬁcient
algorithm in the permutation space which provides only an
estimate of the bits. We ﬁrst describe the DIM used here.
The DIM maps a binary vector b = (b0 , . . . , bn−1 ) of length
n to a vector σ = (σ0 , . . . , σn ) of length n + 1 in Sn+1 .

We start from the identity permutation σ (−1) = (0, . . . , n).
The bit b0 permutes the ﬁrst two coordinates, resulting in a
(0)
(0)
vector σ (0) = (σ0 , . . . , σn ). For i = 1, . . . , n − 1 the bit bi
(i−1)
(i−1)
permutes the coordinates σi
and σi+1 of σ (i−1) . Let Π0
denote this mapping. The example below illustrates the map
of b = (1, 1, 0, 1) to the permutation vector (1, 2, 0, 4, 3). For
brevity of exposition we write the vector σ in a compact form,
σ = 12043. Underlined portions denote the affected symbols.

If the rate of the binary code is R then the rate of
transmission of information bits is Rn/(n+1). From the DIM
and the estimation algorithm it can be inferred that only about
“half” the permutation space is used for communication over
an M -FSK channel. At the i-th time instance, the symbols
i + 2, . . . , n are used neither during transmission nor during
the decoding procedure. If the DIM is from a linear binary
code of dimension k = Rn, then one can achieve a rate of
k/(n + 1) + (k − 3)/(n − 2) by utilizing the unused symbols

III. DIM FROM 2m - ARY VECTORS TO PERMUTATIONS
In this section we describe a modiﬁcation to the mapping
in Section II so that it can be used for q-ary vectors where
q = 2m . The primary aim is to provide a simple means of
estimating the symbols used. The idea is to use a binary representation of each symbol and map that binary representation
of length m to an m+1 length permutation vector. We give an
example below and then we describe the algorithm formally.
We denote this mapping by Π1 . For brevity, we write the
vectors in a compact form.

The proposition below can be derived from the results in [5].
Proposition 2.3: (see [5]) The mapping Π0 is a DIM with
d(Π0 (b), Π0 (b )) ≥ d(b, b ) + nR , where nR is the number
of runs of ones in supp b ∪ supp b , where supp b denotes the
support of the vector b.

E XAMPLE 3.1: Let q = 22 and let the symbols {0, 1, 2, 3}
be mapped to their natural binary representation as 0 →
00, 1 → 01, 2 → 10, and 3 → 11. The vector s = 132 is

A. Estimating bits from the permutation vector
A very simple estimation procedure gives the correct binary
bit if the received symbol is correct in the corresponding
coordinate. The algorithm is described below. We denote an
erasure by the symbol ε. Let the vector received as the
output of the channel be denoted by y. It lies in the space
{Zn+1 ∪ ε}n+1 .
A LGORITHM 2.4: Estimating bits from y

if yi = i + 1 then ˆi ← 1
b
elseif yi < i + 1 then ˆi ← 0
b
else ˆi ← ε.
b
ˆ
The estimate b can be now provided to the decoder for
the binary code for decoding. Clearly, the above algorithm
never introduces any error if the coordinate yi is correct.
Hence, this procedure can correctly decode with a bounded
distance decoder if the number of errors ne and the number
of erasures nε satisfy the condition 2ne + nε < d, where
d is the minimum distance of the binary code. In practice
the algorithm potentially corrects more errors. For example if
the transmitted symbol corresponding to bi = 0 is different
from the received symbol yi , but the received symbol satisﬁes
yi < i + 1 then there is no error in estimating the bit ˆi .
b
This algorithm performs at most 2n comparisons and has
a memory requirement of exactly one symbol at each step.
In comparison the decoding algorithm in Swart & Ferreira
[7] performs decoding in the permutation space, under M FSK signaling, and requires O(M 2 + nM ) computations and
2
o(3nM ) memory.

σim+j ← σim+j+1
The estimation procedure for the symbols is the same as
described in Section II-A. We estimate the bits and then
recombine the bits to form the symbols. This is an efﬁcient
and reasonably effective method of estimating the symbols
provided that the number of errors and erasures introduced by
the channel is low. The number of comparisons required is
at most 2mn. One drawback of this DIM is that the rate of
1
transmission of information bits decreases by a factor of m .
IV. DPM FROM BINARY VECTORS TO PERMUTATIONS
In this section we develop a new distance preserving map
(DPM) from binary vectors to permutation vectors, which
allows us to estimate the binary symbols efﬁciently. The
mapping converts a length n binary vector to a length n + 1
permutation vector in Sn+1 . This method is introduced so that

bi−1 . Then we show that either σi = σi or σi−1 = σi−1 .
n−1
Let ∆i = l=i bl −bl . Note that if b0 = b0 then the vectors
are clearly different in at least the ﬁrst 2 positions. So, let
i ≥ 2. First, suppose that ∆i = 0. Clearly, bi−1 = bi−1 implies
σi = σi . Now, assume that ∆i = 0. If σi = σi then without
loss of generality assume that bi−1 = 0 and bi−1 = 1. Using
Lemma 4.5 in the equation σi = σi leads to the condition
i = −∆i . We claim that σi−1 = σi−1 . Suppose not. We get

it can be generalized to a new DPM from ternary vectors
to permutations in the next section. The following lemma is
essential to the constructions in the remaining sections.
Lemma 4.1: Let (σ0 , . . . , σl ) be a permutation of
(0, 1, . . . , l). Then σ = (σ0 +i, . . . , σl +i, l+1+i, . . . , l+j+i)
mod (l +j + 1) is a permutation of the vector (0, 1, . . . , l +j),
and the modulo is performed on each coordinate of the vector.
Proof: Consider the vector Σ = (0, . . . , l, l + 1, . . . , l + j)
in Sl+j+1 . Adding i modulo l + j + 1 to each coordinate of
Σ results in a vector Σ + i which is a cyclic shift of Σ to the
left by i positions. Hence Σ + i is also in Sl+j+1 . Considered
as an unordered tuple, the elements of σ are the same as the
elements of Σ + i and hence σ is also a vector in Sl+j+1 .
We now describe the algorithm to map the binary vectors to the permutation vectors. For a binary vector b =
(b0 , . . . , bn−1 ) the algorithm proceeds recursively as follows.
Consider the binary vector as a {0, 1}-vector in R. The
algorithm is initialized by starting with the identity permutation represented as σ (−1) = (0, 1, . . . , n). For each i =
0, . . . , n − 1, the element bi is added to the ﬁrst i + 2 positions
of the permutation vector σ (i−1) modulo (i + 2), where σ (i−1)
is the vector resulting from the previous iteration. Denote the
DPM by Π2 . The example below illustrates the procedure.

Proposition 4.4: Π2 is a DPM from Zn to Sn+1 , that is for

2
Before providing the proof of the proposition we determine
the output of the mapping Π2 as a nonrecursive function of the
input bits bi , i = 0, . . . , n − 1. For brevity of the exposition,
we introduce the notation [a]p to denote a mod p. Recall that
the binary vector b is considered as a {0, 1}-vector over R.

We consider the different possibilities of bi−2 and bi−2 . If
bi−2 = bi−2 then (1) results in ∆i = 1, a contradiction to
i = −∆i . Similarly, one obtains contradictions for other values
of bi−2 and bi−2 . Finally, we show by induction that if bi+j =
bi+j , j = 0, . . . , k − 1, then σi+j = σi+j for at least k terms
of j ∈ {0, . . . , k}. The case k = 1 is proved above. Assume
it is true for any k − 1 consecutive bi+j ’s. The only nontrivial case we need to consider is if σi = σi and σi+k =
σi+k . We claim this is not possible. Suppose σi+k = σi+k .
Then using bl−1 − bl−1 ∈ {−1, 0, 1}, for l = 1, . . . , n, we
write σl − σl = −(bl−1 − bl−1 )l + ∆l . Using σi+k − σi+k =
−(bi+k−1 − bi+k−1 )(i + k) + ∆i+k = 0, we get σi − σi =
−(bi−1 −bi−1 )i+∆i −∆i+k−1 +(bi+k−1 −bi+k−1 )(i+k +1).
Since | − (bi−1 − bi−1 )i + ∆i − ∆i+k−1 | ≤ i + k − 1 and the
last term of σi − σi is ±(i + k + 1), we get σi = σi .
A. Estimating the bits from the permutation vector
In this section we consider a method to estimate the
bits from the permutation vectors, with low complexity. The
estimated bits can then be provided to the decoder of the
binary code for further processing. The main idea behind the
estimation method is the following lemma.
Lemma 4.6: Let Π2 (b) = σ. The difference between any
two coordinates σi , σj for j > i satisﬁes
σi − σj

> 0,
< 0,

if bj−1 = 1,
if bj−1 = 0.

Proof: We get,
j−2
σi − σj = [i + bi−1 ]i+1 + l=i bl + bj−1 − [j + bj−1 ]j+1 .
The statements in the lemma follow from the observation that
j−2
[i + bi−1 ]i+1 + l=i bl ≤ j − 1.
Let the received vector from the channel be denoted by
y ∈ {Zn+1 ∪ ε}n+1 . By Lemma 4.6, it is clear that the
simplest estimation algorithm will consider a pair of distinct
coordinates yi , yj and determine bj−1 from their difference.
This can lead to erroneous estimation if either of the two
coordinates are in error. However, correct estimation of bj−1
is guaranteed if both the coordinates are correct. If yj = ε,
then bj−1 can not be determined from yj and we set ˆj−1 = ε.

Algorithm 4.7 below describes the procedure.
The term t > 0 in the algorithm corresponds to performing
a majority vote for the estimate ˆj for each j = 0, . . . , n − 1.

Algorithm 4.7 requires at most n(n + 1) additions and subtractions, and 3n + n (n + 1) comparisons. By restricting |Lj |

Lemma 4.5: If Π2 (b) = σ = (σ0 , . . . , σn ), then
σ0 = b0 + · · · + bn−1 ,
σl = [l + bl−1 ]l+1 + bl + · · · + bn−1 , l = 1, . . . , n.
Proof: The output of the mapping Π2 is given by
σ0 = [· · · [[b0 ]2 + b1 ]3 + · · · + bn−1 ]n+1 ,
σl = [· · · [[l + bl−1 ]l+1 + bl ]l+2 + · · · + bn−1 ]n+1 , l > 0.
For any l = 1, . . . , n, we have that [l + bl−1 ]l+1 ≤ l and hence
[l + bl−1 ]l+1 + bl ≤ l + 1. This implies [[l + bl−1 ]l+1 + bl ]l+2 =
[l+bl−1 ]l+1 +bl , that is, we can remove the modulo operation.
Similarly, the modulo operations by l + 3, . . . , n + 1 can be
removed. The same argument shows that σ0 can be obtained
by adding up the bits over R.
Proof of Proposition 4.4: Let b = (b0 , . . . , bn−1 ) and
b = (b0 , . . . , bn−1 ), be {0, 1}-vectors over R. Suppose bi−1 =

to at most a constant number, say , the number of additions
and subtractions can be reduced to at most 2 n, at the cost of
less reliable estimate of the bits in the higher indices. If the
number of errors and erasures are small then one can expect
the above algorithm to perform well even for small |Lj |.

To prove that the mapping Π3 is a DPM we use an analog
of Lemma 4.5 to express the coordinates σi in the output σ
nonrecursively in terms of the input symbols s0 , . . . , sn−1 .
Lemma 5.3: Let Π3 (s) = σ. Then for all i = 0, . . . , n − 1,
σ0 = s0 + · · · + sn−1 ,
σ2i+1 = [2i + 1 + si ]2i+3 + si+1 + · · · + sn−1 ,
σ2(i+1) = [2(i + 1) + si ]2i+3 + si+1 + · · · + sn−1 .
Using this lemma, we can prove the following proposition.
Proposition 5.4: The mapping Π3 from Zn to S2n+1 is a
3
DPM, that is, d(Π3 (s), Π3 (s )) ≥ d(s, s ).
Idea of Proof: We ﬁrst show that si = si implies that either
at least one of σ2i+j − σ2i+j , j = 1, 2 is nonzero, or if both
are zero then σ2i = σ2i . In the latter case, if we additionally
have si−1 = si−1 then we show that σ2i−1 = σ2i−1 .

B. Estimating bits on an erasure channel
The above algorithm simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly on an erasure
channel. Using |Lj | = 1 is sufﬁcient to guarantee that the
ˆ
number of erasures in the estimated bits b is at most the
number of erasures in the received symbols y. In addition,
if the symbol 0 of Sn+1 is present in the received vector
y, then one can immediately estimate all the succeeding bits
correctly, irrespective of the received values from the channel.
This observation is formalized in the following lemma.

A. Estimating the ternary symbols from the permutation vector
The estimation of the ternary symbols from the received
vector is, not surprisingly, more computationally intensive than
the corresponding one in Section IV-A.
Lemma 5.5: Let Π3 (s) = σ. The differences between the
symbols {σ2i+1 , σ2(i+1) } and {σ2j+1 , σ2(j+1) } for j > i
satisﬁes the following conditions. For l ∈ {2i + 1, 2(i + 1)},

Lemma 4.8: Let b ∈ Zn and let σ = Π2 (b). If σj = 0, then
2
bj−1 = 1 and bl = 0 for all l ≥ j.
Proof: If σj = 0 then we have [j + bj−1 ]j+1 + bj + · · · +
bn−1 = 0 over the reals. This can be achieved only when
bj−1 = 1 and bj = · · · = bn−1 = 0.
In the following section we describe how to extend the
algorithms in this section to a DPM from ternary vectors to
permutations.

Consider a DPM from ternary vectors in Zn to permutation
3
vectors in S2n+1 . For a ternary vector s = (s0 , . . . , sn−1 ),
the element si permutes the ﬁrst 2i + 3 coordinates of the
permutation vector. As in the previous section, the construction
is recursive and the ﬁnal permutation vector also affords a
nonrecursive representation in terms of the ternary digits. We
describe the algorithm below. Let the mapping be denoted by
Π3 and consider the ternary digits as elements of the real ﬁeld
R for all the operations below. We ﬁrst illustrate this algorithm
by an example below.

sl +sj −[2j+1+sj ]2j+3 .
l=i+1

For sj ∈ {0, 1}, we get [2j + 1 + sj ]2j+3 = 2j + 1 + sj . Since
j−1
[2i + 1 + si ]2i+3 + l=i+1 sl ≤ 2i + 2 + 2(j − 1 − i) = 2j,
we get that the RHS of the above equation is strictly negative.
For sj = 2, we get [2j + 1 + sj ]2j+3 = 0 and hence the RHS
is always strictly positive.
This lemma suggests the following algorithm to
determine the ternary symbol sj . Let y = (y0 , . . . , y2n )
in {Z2n+1 ∪ ε}2n+1 be the received vector. For l < 2j + 1, if
yl , y2j+1 , y2j+2 are not erasures then we take the differences
yl − y2j+1 and yl − y2(j+1) and declare sj = 0 if both the
differences are negative, sj = 2 if both the differences are
positive, and sj = 1 otherwise. We formalize this procedure
in the following algorithm. This algorithm corresponds to
Algorithm 4.7 of Section IV-A.

Input: y = (y0 , . . . , y2n ) ∈ {Z2n+1 ∪ ε}2n+1

Output: s = (ˆ0 , . . . , sn−1 ) ∈ {Z3 ∪ ε}n

L0 ← φ, the empty set
for j from 1 to n
Lj ← Lj−1 ∪ l : yl = ε, l ∈ {2(j − 1), 2(j − 1) − 1}
if y2j = ε or y2j−1 = ε then sj−1 ← ε
ˆ
else
t = (t0 , t1 , t2 ) ← (0, 0, 0)
for each l in Lj
p = (p0 , p1 ) ← (yl − y2j−1 , yl − y2j )
if p0 < 0 and p1 < 0 then t0 ← t0 + 1
elseif p0 < 0 and p1 > 0 then t1 ← t1 + 1
elseif p0 > 0 and p1 > 0 then t2 ← t2 + 1
if t = (0, 0, 0) then sj−1 ← ε

The maximum sum of the sizes of Lj is bounded as
n
2
j=1 |Lj | ≤ 1 + 3 + · · · + 2n − 1 = n . Hence the maximum
number of comparisons required is 8n+6n2 , and the maximum
number of subtractions and additions required is 3n2 . Using
at most a constant size of |Lj | ≤ leads to less computations,
at the loss of reliability of the symbols in the higher indices.

Symbol error and erasure rates under background noise

mappings was to implement simple estimation algorithms in
the permutation space and provide the estimated digits to
the q-ary code where efﬁcient decoding algorithms can be
implemented. Since the length N = q + Q(n − 1), Q =
log2 q , the information rate of the codes decreases by a
factor of approximately 1/ log2 q for all the algorithms.
We believe that it should be possible to generalize the map
Π3 from ternary vectors to the permutation space to a DPM
Πq : Zn → SN , by using an additional Q symbols at
q
every iteration of the DPM. Hence we have the following:
Conjecture: Map (s0 , . . . , sn−1 ) to (σ0 , . . . , σN −1 ) by Πq :
σ (0) ← ([0+s0 ]q , . . . , [q−1+s0 ]q , q, . . . , q+Q(n−1)−1)
for i from 0 to n − 2
σ (i+1) ← σ (i)
(i+1)
(i)
σj
← [σj + si+1 ]Q(i+1)+q , j ≤ q + Q(i + 1) − 1.
Then Πq is a DPM.

B. Estimating ternary symbols on an erasure channel
An analog of Lemma 4.8 allows us to adopt a simpler
decoding procedure in an erasure channel.
Lemma 5.7: Let s ∈ Zn , σ = Π3 (s). If σ2i+1 = 0 or
3
σ2(i+1) = 0 then si = 2 or si = 1, resp., and sj = 0, j > i.
Remark: If the demodulator can provide soft information on
the reliability of the symbols, then Algorithms 4.7 and 5.6 can
be simpliﬁed by ﬁxing |Lj | = 1 and retaining only the most
reliable symbol from the received symbols at step j.
VI. S IMULATIONS
We consider the PLC channel with M -FSK modulation and
with only background noise, for simplicity. The transmitted
word is represented as an M × M {0, 1}-matrix, where M
is the length of the permutation. A 1 in the i-th row and jth column indicates that the permutation symbol i is sent at
time j. Since we are considering hard decision decoding, we
simulate background noise by ﬂipping the value of any entry
of the matrix with a probability p. The codewords are chosen
at random from BCH codes over the ﬁnite ﬁelds Fq for q =
2, 3, 4. For the maps Π0 , Π1 , the permutation symbol at time
i is taken to be i + 1 if the (i + 1, i)-th entry of the received
matrix is 1; it is assumed ε if all entries (j, i), j ≤ i are
0; otherwise it is assumed j if any (j, i)-th entry is 1 for
j ≤ i. For maps Π2 , Π3 we set the permutation symbol at
time i to ε if the column i does not contain exactly one 1.
Fig. 1 shows the symbol error and erasure rate of the different
estimation algorithms, after decoding the estimated symbols
with a bounded distance error and erasure decoder.
