In [3], they show that strictly causal state information is
beneﬁcial even if the channel is controlled by two independent
states each known to one encoder strictly causally. In this
case, each encoder can help the other encoder transmit at a
higher rate by sending a compressed version of its state to the
decoder. In [4], Li, Simeone and Yener improve the results of
[1], [3] and extend them to the case of multiple encoders. The
achievability results in [4] are inspired by the noisy network
coding scheme of [5] and, unlike [1], [3], do not use WynerZiv binning [6] for the compression of the state. In a very
recent contribution [7], Lapidoth and Steinberg derive a new
inner bound on the capacity region for the case of a single
state governing the multiaccess channel. They also prove that
the inner bound of [4] for the case of two independent states
each known strictly causally to one encoder can indeed be
strictly better than previous bounds in [1], [3] – a result which
is conjectured previously by Li, Simeone and Yener in [4].

Abstract— We consider a two-user state-dependent multiaccess channel in which the states of the channel are
known non-causally to one of the encoders and only strictly
causally to the other encoder. Both encoders transmit a
common message and, in addition, the encoder that knows
the states non-causally transmits an individual message.
We ﬁnd explicit characterizations of the capacity region
of this communication model. The analysis also reveals
optimal ways of exploiting the knowledge of the state only
strictly causally at the encoder that sends only the common
message when such a knowledge is beneﬁcial. The encoders
collaborate to convey to the decoder a lossy version of the
state, in addition to transmitting the information messages
through a generalized Gel’fand-Pinsker binning. Particularly
important in this problem are the questions of 1) optimal
ways of performing the state compression and 2) whether
or not the compression indices should be decoded uniquely.
We show that both compression a-la noisy network coding,
`
i.e., with no binning, and compression using Wyner-Ziv binning are optimal. The scheme that uses Wyner-Ziv binning
shares elements with Cover and El Gamal original compressand-forward, but diﬀers from it mainly in that backward
decoding is employed instead of forward decoding and the
compression indices are not decoded uniquely. Finally, by
exploring the properties of our outer bound, we show that,
although not required in general, the compression indices
can in fact be decoded uniquely essentially without altering
the capacity region, but at the expense of larger alphabets
sizes for the auxiliary random variables.

I. Introduction

Sn

Advances in the study of the eﬀect of strictly causal states in
multiuser channels are rather very recent and concern mainly
multiple access scenarios. In [1], Lapidoth and Steinberg study
a two-encoder multiple access channel with independent
messages and states known causally at the encoders. They
show that the strictly causal state sequence can be beneﬁcial,
in the sense that it increases the capacity for this model. This
result is reminiscent of Dueck’s proof [2] that feedback can
increase the capacity region of some broadcast channels. In
accordance with [2], the main idea of the achievability result
in [1] is a block Markov coding scheme in which the two users
collaborate to describe the state to the decoder by sending
cooperatively a compressed version of it. As noticed in [1],
although some non-zero rate that otherwise could be used to
transmit pure information is spent in describing the state to
the decoder, the net eﬀect can be an increase in the capacity.

Fig. 1. State-dependent MAC with degraded message sets and states
known noncausally at the encoder that sends both messages and only
strictly causally at the other encoder.

In this paper, which generalizes our former work [8], we
study a two-user state-dependent multiple access channel
with the channel states known non-causally at one encoder
and only strictly causally at the other encoder. The decoder
is not aware of the channel states. As shown in Figure 1,
both encoders transmit a common message and, in addition,
the encoder that knows the states non-causally transmits an
individual message. More precisely, let Wc and W1 denote
the common message and the individual message to be
transmitted in, say, n uses of the channel; and Sn = (S1 , . . . , Sn )
denote the state sequence aﬀecting the channel during this
time. At time i, Encoder 1 knows the complete sequence
Sn = (S1 , . . . , Si−1 , Si , . . . , Sn ) and sends X1i = φ1 (Wc , W1 , Sn ),

A rate pair (Rc , R1 ) is said to be achievable if for every > 0
there exists an (2nRc , 2nR1 , n, ) code for the channel WY|X1 ,X2 ,S .
The capacity region of the considered state-dependent MAC
is deﬁned as the closure of the set of achievable rate pairs.
Due to space limitation, the results of this paper are either
outlined only or mentioned without proofs. Detailed proofs,
converse proofs, the characterization of the capacity region in
the Gaussian case as well as other results and discussions can
be found in [11].

and Encoder 2 knows only Si−1 = (S1 , . . . , Si−1 ) and sends X2i =
φ2,i (Wc , Si−1 ) – the functions φ1 and φ2,i are some encoding
functions. In this paper, we establish the capacity region of
this state-dependent MAC model. As our analysis will show,
this requires, among others, understanding the role of the
strictly causal part of the state that is revealed to Encoder 2.
We show that both compression of the state a-la noisy network
`
coding, i.e., with no binning, and compression using WynerZiv binning with or without non-unique decoding of the
compresion indices are optimal. The question of whether nonunique decoding is beneﬁcial in Wyner-Ziv type networks is
important. Related very recent works can be found in [9], [10].

III. Discrete Memoryless Case
In this section, it is assumed that S, X1 , X2 are ﬁnite.

A. Capacity Region

II. System Model and Definitions

Let P stand for the collection of all random variables
(S, U, V, X1 , X2 , Y) such that U, V, X1 and X2 take values in
ﬁnite alphabets U, V, X1 and X2 , respectively, and

We consider a stationary memoryless state-dependent
MAC WY|X1 ,X2 ,S whose output Y ∈ Y is controlled by the
channel inputs X1 ∈ X1 and X2 ∈ X2 from the encoders
and a channel state S ∈ S drawn according to a memoryless
probability law QS . We assume that the channel state Sn is
known non-causally at Encoder 1, i.e., beforehand, at the
beginning of the transmission block. Encoder 2 knows the
channel states only strictly-causally; that is, at time i, it knows
the states only up to time i − 1, Si−1 = (S1 , . . . , Si−1 ).
Both encoders transmit a common message Wc and, in
addition, Encoder 1 transmits also an individual message
W1 . We assume that Wc and W1 are independent random
variables drawn uniformly from the sets Wc = {1, · · · , Mc } and
n
n
W1 = {1, · · · , M1 }, respectively. The sequences X1 and X2 from
the encoders are sent across a state-dependent multiaccess
channel modeled as a memoryless conditional probability
distribution WY|X1 ,X2 ,S . The joint probability mass function on
Wc ×W1 ×Sn ×Xn ×Xn ×Yn is given by

PS,U,V,X1 ,X2 (s, u, v, x1 , x2 ) = QS (s).

The relations in (7) imply that (U, V) ↔ (S, X1 , X2 ) ↔ Y is a
Markov chain, and X2 is independent of S.
Deﬁne C to be the set of all rate pairs (Rc , R1 ) such that
R1 ≤ I(U; Y|V, X2 ) − I(U; S|V, X2 )
Rc + R1 ≤ I(U, V, X2 ; Y) − I(U, V, X2 ; S)
for some (S, U, V, X1 , X2 , Y) ∈ P.

Remark 1: The proof of achievability of Theorem 1 is based
on a block-Markov coding scheme in which a lossy version
of the state is conveyed to the decoder, in the spirit of [1], [3],
[7], in addition to a generalized Gel’fand-Pinsker binning for
the transmission of the information messages [12]. However,
unlike [1], [3] and [7] where Wyner-Ziv compression is
utilized for the transmission of the lossy version of the state,
here, inspired by the noisy network coding scheme of [5], at
each block the compression index of the state of the previous
block is sent using standard rate distortion, not WynerZiv binning [6]. Also, unlike [1], [3] and [7] where every

with s[i] given (x2,i (wc , ti−1 ), vi (wc , ti−1 , ti )). Denote this ji by
ji = j(s[i], wc , ti−1 , ti , w1 ). If such ji is not found, an error is
declared and j(s[i], wc , ti−1 , ti , w1 ) is set to ji = J. Encoder 1 then
transmits a vector x1 [i] which is drawn i.i.d. conditionally
given ui (wc , ti−1 , ti , w1 , ji ), s[i], vi (wc , ti−1 , ti ) and x2,i (wc , ti−1 )
(using the conditional measure PX1 |U,S,V,X2 induced by (7)).
Decoding: At the end of the transmission, the decoder has
collected all the blocks of channel outputs y[1], . . . , y[B].
Step (a): The decoder estimates message wc using all blocks i =
ˆ
1, . . . , B, i.e., simultaneous decoding. It declares that wc is sent
ˆ
if there exist tB = (t1 , . . . , tB ) ∈ [1 : M]B , w1 ∈ [1 : M1 ] and jB =
ˆ
ˆ
(j1 , . . . , jB ) ∈ [1 : J]B such that x2,i (wc , ti−1 ), ui (wc , ti−1 , ti , w1 , ji ),
ˆ
vi (wc , ti−1 , ti ) and y[i] are jointly typical for all i = 1, . . . , B. One
can show that the decoder obtains the correct wc as long as n
and B are large and

information message is divided into blocks and diﬀerent
submessages are sent over these blocks and then decoded
one at a time using the same codebook as in the original
compress-and-forward scheme by Cover and El Gamal [13],
here the entire common message and the entire individual
message are transmitted over all blocks using codebooks that
are generated independently, one for each block, and the
decoding is performed simultaneously using all blocks as
in [5]. At the end of the transmission, the receiver uses the
outputs of all blocks to perform simultaneous decoding of
the information common and individual messages, without
uniquely decoding the compression indices.
Proof of Achievability:
The transmission takes place in B blocks. The common
message Wc and the individual message W1 are sent over
all blocks. We thus have BWc = nBRc , BW1 = nBR1 , N = nB,
RWc = BWc /N = Rc and RW1 = BW1 /N = R1 , where BWc is
the number of common message bits, BW1 is the number of
individual message bits, N is the number of channel uses
and RWc and RW1 are the overall rates of the common and
individual messages, respectively.
Codebook Generation: Fix a measure PS,U,V,X1 ,X2 ,Y ∈ P. Fix
ˆ
> 0, ηc > 0, η1 > 0, η > 0, δ > 1 and denote Mc = 2nB[Rc −ηc ] ,
ˆ ˆ
ˆ
M1 = 2nB[R1 −η1 ] , M = 2n[R+η ] and J = 2n[I(U;S|V,X2 )+δ ] .
We randomly and independently generate a codebook for
each block.
ˆ
1) For each block i, i = 1, . . . , B, we generate Mc M independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) codewords
ˆ
x2,i (wc , ti ) indexed by wc = 1, . . . , Rc , ti = 1, . . . , M, each
with i.i.d. components drawn according to PX2 .
2) For each block i, for each codeword x2,i (wc , ti ), we
ˆ
generate M i.i.d. codewords vi (wc , ti , ti ) indexed by ti =
ˆ each with i.i.d. components drawn according to
1, . . . , M,
PV|X2 .
3) For each block i, for each codeword x2,i (wc , ti ), for each
codeword vi (wc , ti , ti ), we generate a collection of JM1
i.i.d. codewords {ui (wc , ti , ti , w1 , ji )} indexed by w1 =
1, . . . , M1 , ji = 1, . . . , J, each with i.i.d. components draw
according to PU|V,X2 .
Encoding: Suppose that a common message Wc = wc and
an individual message W1 = w1 are to be transmitted. As we
mentioned previously, wc and w1 will be sent over all blocks.
We denote by s[i] the state aﬀecting the channel in block i,
i = 1, . . . , B. For convenience, we let s[0] = ∅ and t−1 = t0 = 1
(a default value). The encoding at the beginning of block i,
i = 1, . . . , B, is as follows.
Encoder 2, which has learned the state sequence s[i−1], knows
ˆ
ti−2 and looks for a compression index ti−1 ∈ [1 : M] such that
vi−1 (wc , ti−2 , ti−1 ) is strongly jointly typical with s[i − 1] and
x2,i−1 (wc , ti−2 ). If there is no such index or the observed state
s[i − 1] is not typical, ti−1 is set to 1 and an error is declared.
If there is more than one such index ti−1 , choose the smallest.
Encoder 2 then transmits the vector x2,i (wc , ti−1 ).
Encoder 1 obtains x2,i (wc , ti−1 ) similarly. It then ﬁnds the
ˆ
smallest compression index ti ∈ [1 : M] such that vi (wc , ti−i , ti )
is strongly jointly typical with s[i] and x2,i (wc , ti−1 ). Again, if
there is no such index or the observed state s[i] is not typical,
ti is set to 1 and an error is declared. Next, Encoder 1 looks for
the smallest ji such that ui (wc , ti−1 , ti , w1 , ji ) is jointly typical

Rc + R1 ≤ I(U, V, X2 ; Y) − I(U, V, X2 ; S).

(10)

Step (b): Next, the decoder estimates message w1 using again
all blocks i = 1, . . . , B, i.e., simultaneous decoding. It declares
ˆ
ˆ
that w1 is sent if there exist tB = (t1 , . . . , tB ) ∈ [1 : M]B , jB =
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
(j1 , . . . , jB ) ∈ [1 : J]B such that x2,i (wc , ti−1 ), ui (wc , ti−1 , ti , w1 , ji ),
ˆ
vi (wc , ti−1 , ti ) and y[i] are jointly typical for all i = 1, . . . , B. One
can show that the decoder obtains the correct w1 as long as n
and B are large and
R1 ≤ I(U; Y|V, X2 ) − I(U; S|V, X2 )

(11a)

R1 ≤ I(U, V, X2 ; Y) − I(U, V, X2 ; S).

(11b)

B. Wyner-Ziv Binning With Non-unique Decoding is Optimal
In the coding scheme of Theorem 1, the state compression is
standard, i.e., uses no Wyner-Ziv binning, the same message
is sent in every block, and the decoding of the sent message is
performed jointly using all blocks. Although of no beneﬁt
in the case of one relay, the combination of these three
features was shown to be essential in achieving rates that
are strictly larger than those oﬀered by schemes based on
Cover and El Gamal classic compress-and-forward scheme
[13] for certain networks with multiple relays in [5]. That is,
the coding scheme of [5] outperforms Cover and El Gamal
classic compress-and-forward for some multi-relay networks
in [5]. One can wonder whether the same holds for our
model, i.e., whether schemes based on Cover and El Gamal
classic compress-and-forward, i.e., block Markov encoding
combined with Wyner-Ziv binning, fall short of achieving
optimality for our model. In this paper, we show that the
capacity region C as given by (8) can be achieved alternatively
with a coding scheme that we obtain by building upon
and modifying Cover and El Gamal original compress-andforward scheme. The modiﬁcation consists essentially in 1)
decoding block-by-block backwardly instead of block-byblock forwardly and 2) non-unique decoding of the compression indices. (In fact, by investigating more closely the
converse proof of Theorem 1, we will show later that 2) can
be relaxed essentially without altering the capacity region).
The following theorem states the result.
Theorem 2: For the state-dependent multiaccess channel
model that we study, there exists an optimal coding scheme

Encoder 2 then transmits the vector x2 (wc,i , si−1 ), where si−1
is such that zi−1 ∈ Csi−1 .
Encoder 1 obtains x2 (wc,i , si−1 ) similarly. It then ﬁnds the
ˆ
smallest compression index zi ∈ [1, M] such that v(wc,i , si−1 , zi )
is strongly jointly typical with s[i] and x2 (wc,i , si−1 ). Again,
if there is no such index or the observed state s[i] is not
typical, zi is set to 1 and an error is declared. Let si ∈
[1, M0 ] such that zi ∈ Csi . Next, Encoder 1 looks for the
smallest ji such that u(wc,i , si−1 , zi , w1,i , ji ) is jointly typical
with s[i], x2 (wc,i , si−1 ) and v(wc,i , si−1 , zi ). Denote this ji by
ji = j(s[i], wc,i , si−1 , zi , w1,i ). If such ji is not found, an
error is declared and j(s[i], wc,i , si−1 , zi , w1,i ) is set to ji = J.
Encoder 1 then transmits a vector x1 [i] which is drawn i.i.d.
conditionally given s[i], u(wc,i , si−1 , zi , w1,i , ji ), v(wc,i , si−1 , zi )
and x2 (wc,i , si−1 ) (using the conditional measure PX1 |S,U,V,X2
induced by PS,U,V,X1 ,X2 ,Y ∈ P).
1) Decoding in Block B − 1:
The decoding of the pair (wc,B−1 , w1,B−1 ) is performed in four
steps, as follows.
Step (a): The decoder knows wc,B = 1 and looks for the unique
ˆ
ˆ
cell index sB−1 such that the vector x2 (wc,B , sB−1 ) is jointly
typical with y[B]. The decoding operation in this step incurs
small probability of error as long as n is suﬃciently large and

that uses Wyner-Ziv binning for the state compression. That
is, the capacity region C given by (8) can also be achieved using
a coding scheme in which the state compression is performed
using Wyner-Ziv binning.
Proof: The achievability proof of Theorem 2 is based
on a block-Markov coding scheme that combines carefully
Gel’fand-Pinsker binning and Wyner-Ziv binning, and utilizes backward decoding with non-unique decoding of the
compression indices.
The transmission takes place in B blocks. The common
message Wc is divided into B blocks wc,1 , . . . , wc,B of nRc
bits each, and the individual messages W1 are divided into
B blocks w1,1 , . . . , w1,B of nR1 bits each. For convenience,
we let wc,B = w1,B = 1 (a default value). We thus have
BWc = n(B − 1)Rc , BW1 = n(B − 1)R1 , N = nB, RWc = BWc /N =
Rc ·(B − 1)/B and RW1 = BW1 /N = R1 ·(B − 1)/B, where BWc
is the number of common message bits, BW1 is the number
of individual message bits, N is the number of channel uses
and RWc and RW1 are the overall rates of the common and
individual messages, respectively. For ﬁxed n, the average
rate pair (RWc , RW1 ) over B blocks can be made as close to
(Rc , R1 ) as desired by making B large.
Codebook Generation: Fix a measure PS,U,V,X1 ,X2 ,Y ∈ P. Fix >

1) We generate Mc M0 independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) codewords x2 (wc , s) indexed by wc =
1, . . . , Rc , s = 1, . . . , M0 , each with i.i.d. components
drawn according to PX2 .
ˆ
2) For each codeword x2 (wc , s), we generate M independent

ˆ
indexed by z = 1, . . . , M, each with i.i.d. components
drawn according to PV|X2 .
3) For each codeword x2 (wc , s), for each codeword v(wc , s, z),
we generate a collection of JM1 i.i.d. codewords
{u(wc , s, z, w1 , j)} indexed by w1 = 1, . . . , M1 , j = 1, . . . , J,
each with i.i.d. components draw according to PU|V,X2 .
ˆ
4) Randomly partition the set {1, . . . , M} into M0 cells Cs ,
s ∈ [1, M0 ].
Encoding: Suppose that a common message Wc = wc
and an individual message W1 = w1 are to be transmitted.
As we mentioned previously, message wc is divided into B
blocks wc,1 , . . . , wc,B and message w1 is divided into B blocks
w1,1 , . . . , w1,B , with (wc,i , w1,i ) the pair messages sent in block
i. We denote by s[i] the channel state in block i, i = 1, . . . , B.
For convenience, we let s[0] = φ and z0 = 1 (a default value),
and s0 the index of the cell containing z0 , i.e., z0 ∈ Cs0 . The
encoding at the beginning of the block i, i = 1, . . . , B, is as
follows.
Encoder 2, which has learned the state sequence s[i−1], knows
ˆ
si−2 and looks for a compression index zi−1 ∈ [1, M] such that
v(wc,i−1 , si−2 , zi−1 ) is strongly jointly typical with s[i − 1] and
x2 (wc,i−1 , si−2 ). If there is no such index or the observed state
s[i − 1] is not typical, zi−1 is set to 1 and an error is declared.
If there is more than one such index zi−1 , choose the smallest.
One can show that the probability of error of this event is
arbitrarily small provided that n is large and

R > I(V; S|X2 ).

R0 < I(X2 ; Y).

Step (b): The decoder now knows sB−1 (i.e., the index of the cell in which the compression index zB−1
lies). It then decodes message wc,B−1 by looking for the
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
unique wc,B−1 such that x2 (wc,B−1 , sB−2 ), v(wc,B−1 , sB−2 , zB−1 ),
ˆ
u(wc,B−1 , sB−2 , zB−1 , w1,B−1 , jB−1 ) and y[B − 1] are jointly typical
for some sB−2 ∈ [1, M0 ], w1,B−1 ∈ [1, M1 ], jB−1 ∈ [1, J] and
zB−1 ∈ CsB−1 . One can show that the decoder obtains the correct
ˆ
wc,B−1 as long as n and B are large and
ˆ
R0 + (R − R0 ) + Rc + R1 ≤ I(U, V, X2 ; Y) − I(U; S|V, X2 ).

(14)

Step (c): The decoder knows wc,B−1 and can again obtain the
correct sB−2 if n is large and (13) is true. This is accomplished by
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
looking for the unique sB−2 such that the vector x2 (wc,B−1 , sB−2 )
is jointly typical with y[B − 1].
Step (d): Finally, the decoder, which now knows message

ˆ
wc,B−1 and the cell index sB−2 (but not the exact compression inˆ

Next, for b ranging from B − 1 to 2, the decoding of the pair
(wc,b−1 , w1,b−1 ) is performed similarly, in ﬁve steps, by using

as follows.

Applying Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) to project

result (8).

R1 ≤ I(U; Y|V, X2 ) − I(U; S|V, X2 )
Rc + R1 ≤ I(U, V, X2 ; Y) − I(U, V, X2 ; S)
for some measure (S, U, V, X1 , X2 , Y) ∈ P and satisfying
I(V, X2 ; Y) − I(V, X2 ; S) ≥ 0,

|V| ≤ |S||X1 ||X2 | + 2

|U| ≤ |S||X1 ||X2 | + 2 |S||X1 ||X2 |.

Proof: The coding scheme that we use for the proof of
Theorem 3 is very similar to that of Theorem 2, but with
unique decoding of the compression indices. (See [11]).

As we mentioned previously, the coding scheme of Theorem 2 shares elements with Cover and El Gamal original
compress-and-forward [13, Theorem 7]; but diﬀers from it
mainly in two aspects. First, it uses backward decoding
instead of the forward decoding of [13]; and, second, unlike
[13] it does not require unique decoding of the compression
indices. The second aspect is essential for getting the same rate
expression as in (8), with no additional constraints. However,
as we will see shortly in the corollary that will follow, one
can modify the coding scheme of Theorem 2 in a way to get
the compression indices decoded uniquely and still get the
capacity region, at the expense of slightly larger |V| and larger
|U|. The key element is the observation that the constraint
introduced by getting the compression index decoded, i.e.,
(17)

or, equivalently,
I(V, X2 ; Y) − I(V, X2 ; S) ≥ 0,

(20)

where the auxiliary random variables V and U have their
alphabets bounded as

C. Non-unique Decoding is Not Needed

I(V; S|X2 ) − I(V; Y|X2 ) ≤ I(X2 ; Y),

(19)

(18)

is also implicit in the converse proof of Theorem 1. That is, the
auxiliary random variables U and V of the converse proof of
Theorem 1 satisfy (18).
Theorem 3: The coding scheme of Theorem 2 can be
modiﬁed in a way to get the compression index decoded.
The resulting coding scheme is optimal and achieves an
equivalent characterization of the capacity region of the
model that we study given by the set of all rate pairs (Rc , R1 )
such that
