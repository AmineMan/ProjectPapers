II. D IFFERENTIAL AND LINEAR PROPERTIES

Abstract—In this extended abstract we present results on
the inverses modulo 2n − 1 of the known APN exponents. In
particular, we describe explicitly the inverses of the Welch and
Dobbertin exponents and give the main ideas of their proofs.
Further, we observe that the inverse of the Dobbertin exponent
deﬁnes an APN function on F2n of algebraic degree n+3 , which
2
is the ﬁrst example of such a function.

Let F2n be the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order 2n , for basic theory on
ﬁnite ﬁelds we refer to [11].
Deﬁnition 1. (a) A function F : F2n → F2n is called AP N
(almost perfect nonlinear) if for any non-zero a ∈ F2n
and any b ∈ F2n the equation F (x + a) + F (x) = b has
at most 2 solutions.
(b) A function F : F2n → F2n , n odd, is called AB (almost
bent) if

I. I NTRODUCTION
The classical modular inversion is the problem to invert
numbers modulo a ﬁxed number. We consider a dual problem,
inverting a ﬁxed number d modulo 2n − 1 for all suitable n.
Let d be a ﬁxed positive integer and n ≥ 2 such that
gcd(2n − 1, d) = 1. Then d is invertible modulo 2n − 1
for all such n. We denote by d−1 the least positive residue
of d modulo 2n − 1. Are there any properties shared by
the inverses d−1 modulo any 2n − 1? Is it possible to ﬁnd
an explicit formula for d−1 modulo 2n − 1 for all n? In
this paper we study these questions for several families of
integers d: mainly for the exponents of the known APN
power functions on F2n . We call integers deﬁning APN power
function APN exponents. The inverses of APN exponents are
APN as well. It is usually said that the known AP N and AB
power permutations are those listed in Table I (with their shifts
and inverses modulo 2n − 1), cf. [7]. However, for a better
understanding of AP N and AB exponents, it could be helpful
to have explicit representations of these inverses. An important
parameter for an APN exponent is its binary weight, which
deﬁnes the algebraic degree of the corresponding function
and thus resistance of it to some cryptological attacks. The
study of inverses of APN exponents was originated in [13]
and [14], where the inverses and their binary weights for the
so-called Gold and Niho exponents were found respectively.
In this paper we give the inverses and their binary weights
for the so-called Welch and Dobbertin exponents. Herewith
the Kasami exponent remains the only known APN exponent
for which the inverse is not completely understood. For the
Kasami exponent we have some partial results. We generalize
also the work of Nyberg [13], and give results for exponents
of the shape 2k − 1. This paper is an extended abstract, more
complete studies will appear in a forthcoming article.

The AP N and AB functions provide the best resistance
to differential and linear attacks, respectively, when used as
S-boxes in cryptography. There are very few known examples
of AP N and AB functions. The best studied such functions
are the power functions x → xd , x ∈ F2n , where d is a ﬁxed
integer. Power AP N and AB functions play also an important
role in coding theory and in the study of reversed Dickson
polynomials [8], [10].
It is easy to see that a power function F : F2n → F2n is
bijective if and only if gcd(d, 2n −1) = 1.The (compositional)
inverse of a bijective power function F (x) = xd is given by
F −1 (x) = xe where e is the inverse of d modulo 2n − 1, i.e.
ed ≡ 1 (mod 2n − 1).
Deﬁnition 2. Let d and n be positive integers. We denote by
wt2 (d) the Hamming weight of the binary representation of
d, and by wt2,n (d) the Hamming weight of the least positive
residue of d modulo 2n −1. The algebraic degree of the power
function x → xd on F2n is wt2,n (d).
Observe that if 1 ≤ d ≤ 2n − 1 then wt2 (d) = wt2,n (d).
The following theorem summarizes the properties of AP N
and AB power functions, see for example [1], [7], [8].
Theorem 1. 1) An AP N power function on F2n is bijective if n is odd, and it is 3 − to − 1 if n is even
(where 3 − to − 1 means that every non-zero image has
3 preimages).
2) Any AB function is AP N .

3) The (compositional) inverse of an AP N/AB function is
AP N/AB as well.
4) An exponent d deﬁnes AP N/AB function if and only if
2 · d does so.
5) The algebraic degree of an AB function on F2n does
not exceed (n + 1)/2.

III. Q UADRATIC EXPONENTS
The integers of binary weight 2 deﬁne power functions of
algebraic degree 2 on F2n , therefore they are often referred to
as quadratic exponents. The next result is well known, a proof
of it can be found, for example, in [12, Lemma 11.1].

Lemma 1. Let n and k be positive integers. Then
odd if and only if gcd(2k + 1, 2n − 1) = 1; and
even if and only if gcd(2k + 1, 2n − 1) = 2gcd(n,k) + 1.

Remark 2. It is easy to see by direct calculations that

We call integers 2 − 2 + 1 with 0 < k < n Kasami
exponents. In our considerations we may assume k ≤ n , since
2
22k −2k +1 and 22(n−k) −2n−k +1 lie in the same cyclotomic
coset modulo 2n − 1. Indeed, (22(n−k) − 2n−k + 1)22k ≡

(Here we put

Proof: Note that the Kasami exponent satisﬁes:
2) Let n be even and 0 < 2k < n. If gcd(22k −2k +1, 2n −
1) = 1, then k is even as well.

(22k − 2k + 1) (23k − 1)(2k + 1) = 26k − 1.
The rest follows by direct calculations.

The following lemma describes Kasami exponents, which
are invertible modulo (2n − 1).

Remark 3. It is interesting to observe that Kasami exponents
d = 22k − 2k + 1 with small ratio n fulﬁll:
k
n/2+1
• if k = n/2 then c (d) = c (2
− 1)
−1
• if k = n/3 then c (d
) = c (2k + 1)
−1
• if k = n/5 then c (d
) = c (24k − 22k + 1),
where c (a) = c (b) denotes that the integers a and b are in
the same cyclotomic coset.

Lemma 3. It holds gcd(22k − 2k + 1, 2n − 1) = 1 if and only
if one of the following cases occurs:
n
• gcd(n,k) is odd;
n
• gcd(n,k) is even, k is even and gcd(k, n) = gcd(3k, n).
Equivalently, gcd(22k − 2k + 1, 2n − 1) = 1 if and only if
one of the following cases occurs:
• n is odd and k ≥ 1 is arbitrary
r

• n = 2 a and k = 2 b, where a is odd and 1 ≤ r.

• n = 2 3 a and k = 2 3 b, where b is odd, 1 ≤ s < r
and 0 ≤ u ≤ v.

V. W ELCH EXPONENTS
For n = 2t+1, integers of the shape 2t +3 are called Welch
exponents when considered modulo 2n − 1. In contrast to the
quadratic and Kasami exponents, the Welch exponent depends
on n. In fact, it is proved in [9], that the only APN exponents
which do not depend on n are Gold and Kasami exponents.
Our considerations show that the main difﬁculty in ﬁnding
the inverses modulo 2n − 1 for a given integer is to guess
it. After having the conjectural inverse for an integer, usually
the correctness of it follows by easy direct calculations. The
following lemma helps us to guess the inverse of the Welch
exponent.

n
Note that if gcd(n,k) is odd, then 2k + 1 and 23k + 1 are
invertible modulo 2n − 1. Then the observation 22k − 2k + 1 =
(23k + 1)/(2k + 1) together with Theorem 2 implies:

Proposition 1. Let n and k be positive integers such that
n
gcd(n,k) is odd. Then
(22k − 2k + 1)−1 ≡ (2k + 1)(23k + 1)−1

(mod 2n − 1).

Lemma 4. Let n = 2t + 1. Then the inverse ω of the Welch
exponent 2t + 3 modulo 2n − 1 is deﬁned by the following
identity

Theorem 3. Let n = t · gcd(n, k) with t odd and d = 22k −
2k + 1. The least positive residue d−1 satisﬁes:
• If t ≡ 1 (mod 3), then

Remark 4. From Lemma 4 and Theorem 2 it follows that the

calculated as

6

d−1 ≡ 2k−1 1 + 22k (23k − 1)(2k + 1)

(mod 2n − 1).

Multiplying both sides of the above identity by −ω implies:

In particular, if gcd(n, k) = k then wt2,n (d−1 ) =
n−k+2

The advantage of deﬁning identity (3) of ω is that the
involved numbers 17 and 2n − 2t+1 + 5 = 2t+1 (2t − 1) + 5
have binary representations with “easy” combinatorics. This
allows us to ﬁnd the binary representation of the least positive
residue of ω (mod 2n − 1), which will yield the explicit form
and the algebraic degree of the compositional inverse of the
Welch power function.

positive residue of the inverse of Welch exponent modulo
2n − 1. We denote by ωk,0 the binary representation of ωk,0
of length n. The main observation yielding the proof is that
ωk,0 can be found recursively as follows:

Theorem 4. Let ω be the least positive residue of the inverse
of Welch exponent modulo 2n − 1 with n = 2t + 1.
• If t ≡ 0 (mod 8) then

ωk,0 = 1100 0011 ωk−1,0 0110 1001.

ω1,0 = 1100 0011 1 0110 1001
and for k ≥ 2 it holds

In particular, the binary weight of ωk,0 is 8k + 1 = t + 1. By
Lemma 4 it is enough to show that ωk,0 satisﬁes identity (3).
Note that ωk,0 satisfy identity (3) if and only if the sum (with
carry) of the sequence ωk,0 with its 4-shift is the sequence

The classical modular inversion is the problem to invert
numbers modulo a ﬁxed number. We consider a dual problem,
inverting a ﬁxed number d modulo 2n − 1 for all suitable n.
In this paper we found explicitly the inverses for Welch and
Dobbertin exponents. A future project is a systematic study of
this problem for other ﬁxed integers d.

Not much is known about the possible algebraic degrees
of APN functions. By Theorem 6 the inverse of Dobbertin
exponent deﬁnes an APN function on F2n with algebraic
degree exceeding (n + 1)/2 for n odd. The only previously
known such example was the inverse function, with algebraic
degree n − 1. This observation with Theorem 1 (5) shows that
the functions deﬁned by Dobbertin exponent and their inverses
are not AB, which was originally shown in [5] by exploiting
the divisibility properties of corresponding codes.
Corollary 2. Power functions with Dobbertin exponents and
their inverses are not AB.
