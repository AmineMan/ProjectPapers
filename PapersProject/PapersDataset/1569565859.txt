Abstract—We study the problem of transmission of binary
input non-linear functions over a network of mobiles based on
CDMA. Motivation for this study comes from the application
of using cheap measurement devices installed on personal cellphones to monitor environmental parameters such as air pollution, temperature and noise level. Our model resembles the
MAC model of Nazer and Gastpar except that the encoders are
restricted to be CDMA encoders. Unlike the work of Nazer and
Gastpar whose main attention is transmission of linear functions,
we deal with non-linear functions with binary inputs. A main
contribution of this paper is a lower bound on the computational
capacity for this problem. While in the traditional CDMA
system the signature matrix of the CDMA system preferably has
independent rows, here the signature matrix of the CDMA system
is viewed as the parity check matrix of a linear code, reﬂecting
our treatment of the interference. We also introduce the problem
of Slepian-Wolf compression with the same compression matrix.

Fig. 1. The communication model. The observations O1 , · · · , OL are passed
through encoders (resulting in Ti ’s), multiplied by signatures (the si ’s) of a
CDMA systems and transmitted over the air (a Gaussian MAC channel). The
receiver gets sum of the transmitted signals plus noise (i.e. Y ), and wants to
recover a function f (O1 , · · · , OL ) of the observations (denoted by U ). In
the general model we also allow for b distinct functions instead of just one.

personal exposures or the general pollution maps). To ﬁnd the
answer, it is not sufﬁcient to have a pollution map, but also the
population density at the polluted areas at various times in a
day. Let us take the average of the measurements by the mobile
sensors that are being carried by the residents as they move
in the city. There will be just more cell-phones in populated
areas and we can simultaneously take into consideration both
the pollution and the population density.
Note that when the mobile system in the application is
employing the CDMA system, it is preferable to use the same
architecture to transmit functions of measurements by the cellphones. Thus, we are considering the problem of function
transmission over a network of mobiles based on CDMA.
We argue that ﬁnding the optimal scheme for transmission
of functions can be studied from two different criteria: i.e.
maximizing privacy and minimizing transmission rates. Transmission of the whole data (rather than a function of it) may
not only be bad in terms of transmission rates, but also it
may compromise the privacy of cell-phone users. Therefore
we can either maximize privacy or minimize transmission rates
over all codes that allow reliable function computation. For the
Korner-Marton problem [3] the two criteria yield exactly the
same answer1 ; but we believe in general they may be different.
Nonetheless in this study we follow the traditional approach

The problem of decoding functions of sources rather than
the sources themselves in a Multiple Access Channel (MAC)
has been studied in several works (see for instance [2] and
its follow up works, also [3] and [4]). It has been shown that
separation is not always optimal in such scenarios, even when
the sources are independent [2]. The intuitive reason for this is
that the interference caused by other users could be exploited
to compute a given function over the air, if the pattern of the
interference matches the functions we want to compute.
All of the previous models for transmission of functions
over MAC (that we know of) do not impose any restrictions
on the encoders, except perhaps on the input power. However some promising emerging applications may violate this
assumption. We were motivated by one such application to
impose a CDMA system as being part of the encoders.
The application is monitoring the exposure of humans to
environmental parameters such as air pollution, temperature,
etc. since the authors are living in one of the world’s most
polluted cities. The traditional way of monitoring is to install
measurement devices distributed over a given area. Suggestion
has been made to install low cost measurement devices on
personal cell-phones, e.g. see [1]. Although the focus of this
paper is not the application, but we would like to mention a
motivation for this application since it may be new (we have
not seen it in the literature). Suppose we are interested in
the collective exposure of residents to air pollution (not just

1 This is because the equivocation rate for each user is bounded from above
by the entropy of their source conditioned on the function to be computed,
which is exactly what the Korner-Marton scheme achieves.

of minimizing the transmission rates.
Our model is shown in Fig. 1 which is similar to the one
considered in [2], except for addition of the signature matrices.
It is discussed rigorously in Sec. III. But before that in Sec.
II, we intuitively discuss our interpretation of the signature
matrix of the CDMA system as the parity check matrix of
a linear code, demonstrating our treatment of interference.
Sec. IV contains our main result, providing a lower bound
on the computational capacity for our problem. The bound
is expressed in terms of the answer to another problem that
we introduce, i.e. the problem of Slepian Wolf with the same
compression matrices (discussed in Sec. V). We believe the
latter problem can itself be of independent interest. Sec. VI
discusses the lower bound of [2] applied to transmission of
non-linear functions in our setting. We will not be discussing
any upper bounds, but one can derive an upper bound using the
ideas in [2] by merging all the transmitters into one node (the
same technique used in some versions of the cut-set bound).

The above simple example can be extended to more general
setups. It turns out that if we interpret the signature matrix as
a parity check matrix, and take a function f that is equal to a
constant over any coset of the parity check matrix2 , we will
be able to perfectly recover f when the channel is noiseless.
When the channel is noisy, one can overcome noise via precoding; this is explained formally in Sec. IV.

In this section we deﬁne the communication model for our
problem. Some of the notation we encounter as we go along
the paper are summarized in Table I. For a r.v. T we use T n
as a shorthand for the sequence (T [1], T [2], . . . , T [n]).
Assume that there are L cell-phones. Let us denote the
observation of the i-th cell-phone by r.v. Oi taking values
in the discrete set Oi . R.Vs O1 , O2 , . . . , OL are jointly distributed according to a given pO1 ,O2 ,...,OL (o1 , o2 , . . . oL ). We
assume that the L cell-phones are observing i.i.d. repetitions
O1 , O2 , . . . , OL . The goal of the cell-phones is to enable
the base station to recover i.i.d. repetitions of b functions
of the observations which we denote by Ui (1 ≤ i ≤ b),
Ui = fi (O1 , O2 , . . . , OL ).
Deﬁnition of a code: (see Fig. 1) A code consists of

In this section we discuss our use of the signature matrix
as a parity check matrix at a very simplistic level to convey
the basic intuitions. Let us assume that we have only three
cell-phones. These cell-phones are observing binary random
variable O1 , O2 and O3 respectively. The goal of the base
station is to recover a boolean function of O1 , O2 and O3 .
Let us assume that the cell-phones directly insert their uncoded
bits into a CDMA system with a given signature matrix. For
instance, if the signature matrix is

the signature of the ﬁrst, second and the third cell-phones
would be the vectors s1 = (1, 1)t , s2 = (1, 0)t and s3 = (0, 1)t
respectively. Assuming tight power control, the receiver gets
the vector O1 s1 +O2 s2 +O3 s3 plus some noise. Let us assume
that there is no noise for now. In this case, the receiver gets two
symbols, the ﬁrst of which is Y1 = O1 +O2 and the second one
is Y2 = O1 +O3 . Note that the summation here is real addition
in R, and not in the ﬁeld F2 . Because Oi takes values in {0, 1},
Y1 and Y2 will be numbers in the set {0, 1, 2}. If Y1 = 0, we
can conclude that O1 = O2 = 0. The value of Y2 would then
specify O3 . Similarly, when (Y1 , Y2 ) = (2, 1) we can ﬁgure
out O1 , O2 and O3 exactly. However, when (Y1 , Y2 ) = (1, 1),
there are two possibilities: (O1 , O2 , O3 ) can be (1, 0, 0) or
(0, 1, 1). If one were to compute a function f (O1 , O2 , O3 ) at
the receiver, the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for doing
so would be that f (1, 0, 0) = f (0, 1, 1). Note that this implies
3
that among 22 plausible boolean functions, half of them are
computable with the given signature matrix. Now, observe that
if we interpret the signature matrix given in equation (1) as
a parity check matrix, the codewords would be the triples
(0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1). This implies that the triples (1, 0, 0) and
(0, 1, 1) form a coset for this codebook, because their mod-2
sum is a codeword. The constraint f (1, 0, 0) = f (0, 1, 1) says
that f has to be constant over this coset.

repetitions of Oi ) into a sequence of n bits (denoted by
Tin ),
2) A binary signature si of length N for the i-th cell-phone,
3) One decoder at the receiver.
nN
The actual signals transmitted over the air are Xi for i ∈
[1 : L], that are formed by multiplying each bit of encoder’s
output Tin into the signature si . Note that the length of Tin is
n, and the length of si is N . Since each bit of Tin is multiplied
by the whole sequence si in the CDMA system, the output will
nN
be a binary string of length nN , denoted by Xi .
nN
Assuming a CDMA power control, the transmitted Xi
goes through a Gaussian MAC channel, and the receiver gets
L
Y nN where Y [i] =
j=1 Xj [i] + Z[i], i ∈ [1 : nN ] for a
Gaussian noise sequence Z nN . The receiver (base station)
takes the output sequences Y nN and passes it through a
decoder to reconstruct the b functions Uik (i ∈ [1 : b]). The
probability of error of the code is taken to be the probability
that Uik = Uik for some i ∈ [1 : b]. The rate of the code is

taken to be R = nN . To impose a power constraint on the

and the variance of Z[i] is σ 2 .
Computational Capacity: Given a signature length N , A
communication rate RN is said to be achievable if there is a sequence of codes, Cn for n ∈ N, all having signatures of length
N , such that limn→∞ Pe (Cn ) = 0 and limn→∞ R(Cn ) = RN
where Pe (Cn ) and R(Cn ) are the probability of error and rate
of the code respectively. The computational capacity for a
signature length N , CN , is taken to be the supremum of the
set of achievable rates for that signature length N .

distributed according to p(v1 , v2 , v3 ). I.i.d. repetitions of these
three sources are observed by three parties, who want to communicate these i.i.d. repetitions to a fourth party, Alice, using
noiseless links of rates R1 , R2 , and R3 . We are interested in
the case of R1 = R2 = R3 = R. The minimum possible value
of R will be the minimum value of R such that (R, R, R) is
in the Slepian-Wolf region. We call this RSW . We know that
for any R > RSW we can achieve the rate triple (R, R, R)
using linear codes: there are matrices B1 , B2 and B3 (of size
nR × n) where the three parties can use and send B1 V1n ,
B2 V2n and B3 V3n where Vin is a column vector consisting of
Vi [j] for j ∈ [1 : n]. The multiplication is in the ﬁeld F2 .
Now, what if we are interested to ﬁnd a single matrix B,
such that having BV1n , BV2n and BV3n we can recover (V1n ,
V2n and V3n )? The three parties are sending at rates R1 =
R2 = R2 = R to Alice using the same compression matrix
s.c.
B. We denote the minimum value of R in this case by RSW .
s.c.
Clearly RSW is larger than or equal to RSW (deﬁned in the
previous paragraph), because more restrictions are imposed on
s.c.
s.c.
the deﬁnition of RSW . But is RSW always equal to RSW ? We
s.c.
show in Claim 2 that this is not true. The deﬁnition of RSW
can be extended to more than three parties in the natural way.
Use of the same matrix B to compress correlated data
(or Slepian-Wolf with the same compression matrices) arises
naturally in our problem. It is also related to the “syndrome
technique” whereby a single code based is constructed for
distributed compression (see for instance [5][6][7]). And after
all, it is interesting to ﬁnd the best compression rate one can
achieve if a universal compression code is used by all nodes
in a distributed source coding problem.
s.c.
We do not know the exact value of RSW , but prove a few
results about it.
Claim 1: Let us assume we have only two binary r.v.’s
s.c.
V1 and V2 . Let K = V1 + V2 (mod 2). Then RSW for
transmission of these two r.v’s is less than or equal to
max(H(K), H(V1 |K)).
Proof: Let R = max(H(K), H(V1 |K)). Here is the
sketch of the proof: let us generate the coordinates of the
common compression matrix B (of size nR × n) uniformly
and randomly from {0, 1}. Then having BV1n and BV2n , we
can add them modulo two to get B(V1n + V2n ) = BK n . Since
R ≥ H(K), B is a good source code for recovering K n
with high probability. Hence we can decode K n ﬁrst. The
Slepian-Wolf rate for recovering V1n with K n serving as a
side information is H(V1 |K). Since R ≥ H(V1 |K), B is a
good SW code with high probability. Therefore we can ﬁnd
V1n . Having V1n and K n , we can also recover V2n .
Claim 2: There exists V1 , · · · , Vr such that the value of
s.c.
RSW is strictly larger than RSW . Next, for any p(v1 , · · · , vr ),
s.c.
RSW is less than or equal to min(rRSW , maxi H(Vi )).
Proof: Let V1 = V2 = · · · = Vr . Then RSW , i.e. the
minimum value of R such that (R, R, R) is in the Slepians.c.
Wolf region, is equal to H(V1 ) . However, RSW is equal to
r
H(V1 ).
s.c.
To show that RSW ≤ rRSW always holds, we start from
an arbitrary code for RSW , and construct another code for

To understand the statement of the main result, we need
to introduce the problem of Slepian-Wolf with the same

convert Tj [i] into a ± bipolar signal. However, use of 0/1 signals makes the
exposition of the paper more appealing. Furthermore random variables Tj [i]
that we will end up using will have a uniform distribution over {0, 1} and can
be adjusted to bipolar signals at the very last stage to decrease the average
power consumption, while leaving the arguments unchanged.

VI. C OMPARISON WITH THE COMPUTATIONAL CAPACITY
OF NAZER AND G ASTPAR
In this section we discuss how our lower bound extends
the result of Nazer and Gastpar in [2]. We ﬁnd the set of
functions where we can use the result of Nazer and Gastpar,
and the lower bound it gives us.
Our formulation above is similar to the one given by Nazer
and Gastpar [2], except that we have a signature matrix here.
Nonetheless, if we ﬁx the signature matrices, we can think
of a virtual channel between the encoder and decoders that
includes the signature matrix. The input to this virtual channel
L
is (T1 , T2 , ..., TL ) and the output is Y (1 : N ) = i=1 Ti si (1 :
N )+Z(1 : N ) where the noise vector Z(1 : N ) has covariance
matrix σ 2 I. If we use the virtual channel n times, we get an
output vector of size nN that we were denoting by Y nN .
In this case we can write down the lower bound given in [2]
when we have a linear function over a ﬁeld. We are mainly
concerned with functions with binary inputs. The only linear
function on the ﬁeld F2 is the XOR function. So this already
puts limitations on the lower bounds we can get by [2]. When
Ui (for 1 ≤ i ≤ b) is the XOR of a subset of the observations
O1 , ..., OL , we get the following lower bound

O3 of Fig. 2. The plot is in terms of p(W2 = 1) and p(W3 = 1) when
p(W1 = 1) = 0.

the same ﬁeld using a particular construction (rather than one
single linear function over a larger ﬁeld). In order to transmit
several functions over a channel, [2] uses a successive SlepianWolf type scheme. Our model allows us to do better than this.
Through an appropriate choice of the signature matrix, we can
run part of the transmission of the functions in parallel, getting
an extra gain compared to the scheme considered by [2].

f (O1 , O2 , O3 ) = O1 O2 O3 + O1 O2 O3

This is not a linear function in the ﬁeld F2 . Let us assume that
N = 2. We can use the signature matrix given in equation
1 since f is constant over all of its cosets. We have V1 =
O1 + O2 (mod 2) and V2 = O1 + O3 (mod 2). Therefore

deﬁnition of rate. Because we are free to choose the signatures

and

The above result works only when the Ui s are the XOR functions of subsets of O1 , ..., OL , and it involves a maximization
problem that we found hard to do, even when we have linear
functions on a ﬁeld.
To compute arbitrary nonlinear boolean functions of the
observations, Nazer and Gastpar suggest that we increase
the ﬁeld size and embed the non-linear function in a linear
function deﬁned on a larger space (see Theorem 2 of [2]).
Although this would not solve the maximization problem over
the signatures s1 , ..., sL mentioned above, it will result in a
lower bound for non-linear functions. In this paper we take
an alternative approach of using several linear functions in

where h(·) is the binary entropy function. The main theorem
implies the following lower bound.

The value of c ≤ 1 depends on σ. For the sake of illustration
we assume that σ is such that c = 0.5.

p(O1 = O2 ) ∈ {0, 1},
p(O1 = O3 ) ∈ {0, 1}.

and

This is expected since in each of the four cases f (O1 , O2 , O3 )
is a constant. It would be interesting to understand the behavior
of the lower bound when p(O1 = O2 ) and p(O1 = O3 ) are
not exactly in {0, 1}, but rather in its vicinity. To study this,
let us consider the model depicted in Fig. 2 in which O1 , O2
and O3 are assumed to be the result of a random variable B
passing through three independent BSC channels, i.e.
O1 = S + W1 , O2 = S + W2 , O3 = S + W3

in a coset into the same number, namely fi (o1 , o2 , . . . , oL )
are all equal, the receiver will be able to exactly recover
fi (o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ).
(II) From the ﬁrst part of the proof we conclude that if we reliably communicate i.i.d. repetitions of Vi = j=1:L hi [j]Oj
(mod 2) to the receiver, it will be able to reliably recover i.i.d.
repetitions of fi (O1 , O2 , . . . , OL ) (1 ≤ i ≤ b). Therefore we
have translated the original problem into that of communicating linear functions. If we think of the signature matrix as
part of a virtual channel between the encoder and decoders,
this virtual channel will be a set linear MACs (as deﬁned by
[2]) in parallel because of the postprocessing at the receiver.
Therefore our setting is not a special case of one considered
by Theorem 1 of [2] because the channel is not a single linear
MAC. Nonetheless we borrow ideas from [2] to extend the
proof of Theorem 1 of [2]; this is not difﬁcult given that the
structure of the virtual channel and the linear functions to be
computed (i.e. Vi s) are prepared to “match”.
It is possible to ﬁnd a binary matrix B of size (kR + ) × k
for the i.i.d. repetitions of (V1 , V2 , ..., Vr ) such one can recover
k
i.i.d. repetitions of V1 , V2 , . . . VL , namely V1k , V2k , . . . , VL ,
k
k
k
from B[V1 V2 · · · VL ]. within a probability of error ,
where by V1k we mean a column vector consisting of the k
i.i.d. repetitions of V1 . The multiplication between the column
vector Vik and B is done in F2 . Next we ﬁnd a channel
coding matrix G of size kR+ × (kR + ) for communicating
c−
over a Gaussian channel with variance σ 2 . The ith cell-phone
k
computes GBOi . It sets this vector of size n = kR+ to
c−
n
be Ti . At time j, the random variable Ti [j] is multiplied by
signature si . The receiver gets j Ti [j]si plus a noise vector.
This is equivalent with getting

mod 2,

where Wi ’s are binary random variables. p(Wi = 1) is the
crossover probability of the ith channel. When p(Wi = 1) ∈
{0, 1}, the lower bound is ∞. Fig. 3 plots the lower bound R
in terms of p(W2 = 1) and p(W3 = 1) when p(W1 = 1) = 0.
VIII. P ROOFS
Proof of Theorem 1: We create the signature matrix of
the CDMA by repeating the matrix H to get a matrix of size
N × L. This means that each of the rows h1 , h2 , ..., hr
would be repeated N times; extra zeros are padded if N
r
r
is not an integer. At the receiver, we can look at the received
Y ’s corresponding to each of the N repetitions and take
r
their average. This would reduce the variance of noise for
2
that transmission to σ 2 = σ . So, this would be as if the
N
r
signature matrix is of size r (instead of N ) identical to H,
and the noise variance is σ 2 (instead of σ 2 ). We are going
to continue assuming that the signature matrix and the parity
check matrix are both H.
At time i, the cell-phones are sending T1 [i], T2 [i], ..., TL [i]
t
respectively. The receiver gets H T1 [i], T2 [i], ..., TL [i] plus
noise where the matrix multiplication here is in R. To convert
the matrix multiplication from R to that in F2 , the receiver
computes the modulo 2 of each received number (as discussed
in the statement of the theorem), mapping it to the interval
t
[− 1 , 3 ). This would be as if H T1 [i], T2 [i], ..., TL [i] (matrix
2 2
multiplication in F2 ) is transmitted but the noise added to this
is no longer Gaussian; it is a Gaussian noise mod 2. Number c
in the statement of the theorem is the capacity of this channel.
Having described the signature matrix, and the decoder’s
mod 2 postprocessing of the signal, we now turn our attention
to the encoders and the decoder. We can divide the rest of
the proof into two parts. The ﬁrst part is a general statement
about recovery of the desired functions of the observations
from Vi ’s. This is used in the second part of the proof to
design the encoders and the decoder.
(I) We ﬁrst claim that given any values for (o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ),
knowing the values of j=1:L hi [j]oj modulo two for i ∈ [1 :
r] is sufﬁcient to perfectly recover fi (o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ) (1 ≤ i ≤
b). To see this note that having r equations j=1:L hi [j]oj
(mod 2) for i ∈ [1 : r] is equivalent to having the product
H[o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ]t in the matrix form; here the multiplication
is in F2 . Note that the number of equations is r whereas the
number of free variables is L, so it ﬁrst seems that the decoder
may not be able to ﬁgure out [o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ]. The decoder can
list the set of all [o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ] such that H[o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ]t
(mod 2) is equal to the received H[o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ]t (mod 2).
This would be the coset associated to [o1 , o2 , . . . , oL ] for the
parity check matrix H. Because fi maps all the sequences

plus noise. Since G is a channel coding matrix, we can recover
k
B[V1k V2k · · · VL ] with high probability. From here we can
k
recover Vi because of the property of B mentioned above.
Thus, we have a good code. The rate of this code is
