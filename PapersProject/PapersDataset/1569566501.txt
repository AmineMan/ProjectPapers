Abstract—We propose two coding schemes combining decodeforward (DF) and noisy network coding (NNC) with different
ﬂavors. The ﬁrst is a combined DF-NNC scheme for the oneway relay channel which includes both DF and NNC as special
cases by performing rate splitting, partial block Markov encoding
and NNC. The second combines two different DF strategies and
layered NNC for the two-way relay channel. One DF strategy
performs coherent block Markov encoding at the source at
the cost of power splitting at the relay, the other performs
independent source and relay encoding but with full relay
power, and layered NNC allows a different compression rate
for each destination. Analysis and simulation show that both
proposed schemes supersede each individual scheme and take
full advantage of both DF and NNC.

observation into two layers: one is used at both destinations,
while the other is only used at one destination.
In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a combined DF-NNC scheme
for the one-way channel. Different from [3], our proposed
scheme performs block Markov encoding and hence encompasses both DF relaying and NNC as special cases. We then
propose a combined DF-LNNC scheme for the TWRC. This
scheme also includes partial block Markov encoding and,
in addition, performs layered NNC. Analysis and numerical
results show that this scheme outperforms each individual
scheme in [4]–[6] and also the combined scheme in [3].

A. Discrete memoryless relay channels
The discrete memoryless two-way relay channel (DMTWRC) is denoted by (X1 × X2 × Xr , p(y1 , y2 , yr |x1 , x2 , xr ),
Y1 × Y2 × Yr ) where (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), (xr , yr ) are input and
output signals of user 1, user 2 and the relay, respectively.
A (n, 2nR1 , 2nR2 , Pe ) code for a DM-TWRC consists of two
message sets M1 = [1 : 2nR1 ] and M2 = [1 : 2nR2 ],
three encoding functions f1,i , f2,i , fr,i , i = 1, . . . , n and two
decoding function g1 , g2 deﬁned as follows:

I. I NTRODUCTION
The relay channel (RC) ﬁrst introduced by van der Meulen
consists of a source aiming to communicate with a destination
with the help of a relay. In [1], Cover and El Gamal propose
the fundamental decode-forward (DF), compress-forward (CF)
and combined DF-CF schemes. Lim, Kim, El Gamal and
Chung recently put forward a noisy network coding (NNC)
scheme [2] for the general multi-source network. NNC is
based on CF relaying but involves three new ideas (message
repetition, no Wyner-Ziv binning and simultaneous decoding)
and outperforms CF for multi-source networks. In [3], Ramalingam and Wang propose a superposition NNC scheme
for restricted relay networks, in which source nodes cannot
act as relays, by combining DF and NNC and show some
performance improvement over NNC. Their scheme, however,
does not include DF relaying rate because of no block Markov
encoding.
The classical one-way relay channel can be generalized
to the two-way relay channel (TWRC), in which two users
exchange messages with the help of a relay. In [4], Rankov
and Wittneben apply several relay strategies, including decodeforward and compress-forward, to the TRWC. In their proposed DF scheme, the two users perform partial block Markov
encoding, and the relay sends a superposition of the codewords
for the two decoded messages in each block. A different
DF strategy is proposed in [5] by Xie, in which the users
encode independently with the relay without block Markovity,
and the relay sends a codeword for the random binning of
the two decoded messages. These two DF schemes do not
include each other in general. In [6], Lim, Kim, El Gamal and
Chung propose an improved NNC scheme termed ”layered
noisy network coding” (LNNC). The relay compresses its

x1,i = f1,i (M1 , Y1i−1 ), x2,i = f2,i (M2 , Y2i−1 ), xr,i = fr,i (Yri−1 ),
n
n
g 1 : Y 1 × M 1 → M 2 , g 2 : Y2 × M 2 → M 1
The deﬁnitions for error probability, achievable rates and
capacity follow standard ones in [7].
The one-way relay channel can be seen as a special case of
the TWRC by setting M2 = X2 = Y1 = ∅, f2 = g1 = null
and R2 = 0.
B. Gaussian one-way and two-way relay channels
The Gaussian one-way relay channel can be modeled as
Y = gX + g2 Xr + Z,

Yr = g 1 X + Z r ,

(1)

where Z, Zr ∼ N (0, 1) are independent Gaussian noises, and
g, g1 , g2 are the corresponding channel gains.
The Gaussian two-way relay channel can be modeled as
Y1 = g12 X2 + g1r Xr + Z1
Y2 = g21 X1 + g2r Xr + Z2
Yr = gr1 X1 + gr2 X2 + Zr ,

(2)

where Z1 , Z2 , Zr ∼ N (0, 1) are independent Gaussian noises
and g12 , g1r , g21 , g2r , gr1 , gr2 are the corresponding channel
gains. For both channels, the average input power constraints
at each user and the relay are all P .

In block j, the source sends
xn (m|mj , mj−1 ). Assume that the relay has successfully

found compression index kj−1 and decoded message mj−1
of the previous block, it then sends xn (kj−1 |mj−1 ).

III. O NE - WAY R ELAY C HANNEL
In this section, we propose a coding scheme combing
decode-forward [1] and noisy network coding [2] for the
one-way relay channel. The source splits its message into
two parts, a common and a private message. The common
message is different in each block and is decoded at both the
relay and destination as in decode-forward, while the private
message is the same for all blocks and is decoded only at the
destination as in noisy network coding. The source encodes the
common message with block Markovity, then superimposes
the private message on top. The relay decodes the common
message at the end of each block and compresses the rest
as in NNC. In the next block, it sends a codeword which
encodes both the compression index and the decoded common
message of the previous block. The destination decodes each
common message by forward sliding-window decoding over
two consecutive blocks. Then at the end of all blocks, it
decodes the private message by simultaneous decoding over
all blocks. Our proposed scheme includes both DF relaying
and NNC as special cases and outperforms superposition NNC
in [3] in that we use block Markov encoding for the common
messages, which provides coherency between source and relay
and improves the transmission rate.

Remark 1. In relay decoding (5), we perform joint decoding
of both the message and the compression index. If we use
sequential decoding to decode the message ﬁrst and then
to ﬁnd the compression index, we still get the same rate
constraints as in Theorem 1.

Remark 2. We can check that the rate in (3) is equivalent
to the combined DF-CF rate in Theorem 7 [1] for the oneway relay channel. This combined DF-CF scheme is recently
shown by Luo et al. [8] to outperform both individual schemes
in the Gaussian channel for a small range of SNR. However,
combined DF-NNC is expected to outperform combined DFCF for multi-source networks.

Remark 3. By setting Ur = Xr , U = X, Yr = 0, the rate in
Theorem 1 reduces to the decode-forward relaying rate [1] as

R2 ≤ min{I6 , I14 } + min{I17 − I2 , I19 }
R1 + R2 ≤ min{min{I5 , I12 } + I15 + I18 − I2 + min{I6 , I14 },

Remark 4. The rate constraints in Theorem 1 are similar to
those in superposition NNC (Theorem 1 in [3]), but the code
distribution (4) is a larger set because of the joint distribution
between (x, u, ur ). Hence the achievable rate by the proposed
scheme is higher than that in [3]. Speciﬁcally, the scheme in
[3] does not include the decode-forward relaying rate in (10).
B. Achievable rate for the Gaussian one-way relay channel

for some joint distribution

We now evaluate the achievable rate in Theorem 1 for the
Gaussian one-way relay channel as in (1).

where Ij are deﬁned in (16)-(21), then R1 is achievable if
user 2 only uses the common layer, while user 1 uses both
the common and reﬁnement layers. If the two users exchange
decoding layers, they can achieve a corresponding set R2 . By
time sharing, the convex hull of R1 ∪ R2 is achievable.

To achieve the rate in (11), we set

IV. T WO - WAY RELAY CHANNEL
In this section, we propose a combined scheme based on
both decode-forward strategies as in [4] [5] and layered noisy
network coding [6] for the two-way relay channel. Each user
splits its message into three parts: an independent common,
a Markov common and a private message. The independent
and Markov common messages are encoded differently at the
source and are different for each block, both are decoded at
both the relay and destination as in decode-forward. The private message is the same for all blocks and is decoded only at
the destination as in noisy network coding. Each user encodes
the Markov common message with block Markov encoding as
in [4], then superimposes the independent common message
on top of it without Markovity, and at last superimposes
the private message on top of both. The relay decodes the
two common messages and compresses the rest into two
layers: a common and a reﬁnement layer. In the next block,
the relay sends a codeword which encodes the two decoded
common messages and two layered compression indices. Then
at the end of each block, each user decodes two common
messages of the other user by sliding-window decoding over
two consecutive blocks. At the end of all blocks, one user
uses the information of the common layer to simultaneously
decode the private message of the other user, while the other

channel, however, are omitted because of the lack of space.

VI. C ONCLUSION
We have proposed two combined schemes: DF-NNC for the
one-way and DF-LNNC for the two-way relay channels. Both
schemes perform message splitting, block Markov encoding,
superposition coding and noisy network coding. Each combined scheme encompasses all respective individual schemes
(DF and NNC or LNNC) and strictly outperforms superposition NNC in [3]. These are initial results for combining
decode-forward and noisy network coding for a multi-source
network.

V. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
We numerically compare the performance of the proposed
combined schemes with the original DF and NNC. The rate
regions are obtained by exhaustive simulation, but optimization can also be used to achieve the maximum rates. Consider
the Gaussian channels as in (1) and (2). Assume all the nodes
are on a straight line. The relay is at a distance d from the
source and distance 1 − d from the destination which makes
g1 = d−γ/2 and g2 = (1 − d)−γ/2 , where γ is the path loss
exponent. Figure 1 shows the achievable rate for the one-way
relay channel with P = 10, γ = 3. The combined DF-NNC
scheme supersedes both the DF and NNC schemes. It can
achieve the capacity of the one-way relay channel when the
relay is close to either the source or the destination. Figure
2 shows the sum rate for the two-way relay channel with
P = 10, γ = 3. Our proposed scheme achieves larger sum
rate than all 3 individual schemes when the relay is close to
either user, while reducing to layered NNC when the relay
is close to the middle of the two users. Figure 3 shows the
achievable rate regions for the Gaussian TWRC using these
4 schemes. The achievable region of our proposed scheme
encompasses all 3 individual schemes.
