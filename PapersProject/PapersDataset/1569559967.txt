A Construction of Quantum Codes via A Class of
Classical Polynomial Codes
Lingfei Jin and Chaoping Xing
For any a ∈ Zn , we deﬁne a q-cyclotomic coset modulo n

Abstract—There have been various constructions of classical
codes from polynomial valuations in literature [2], [7], [8], [10],
[11]. In this paper, we present a construction of classical codes
based on polynomial construction again. One of the features
of this construction is that not only the classical codes arisen
from the construction have good parameters, but also quantum
codes with reasonably good parameters can be produced from
these classical codes. In particular, some new quantum codes are
constructed (see Examples V.5 and V.6).
Index Terms—Cyclotomic cosets, Polynomials, Hermitian selforthogonal, Quantum distance.

It is a well-know fact that all q-cyclotomic cosets partition
the set Zn . Let Sa1 , Sa2 , . . . , Sat stand for all distinct qcyclotomic cosets modulo n. Then, we have that Zn =
t
∪t Sai and n = i=1 |Sai |. We denote by sa the size of
i=1
the q-cyclotomic coset Sa .
The following fact can be easily derived.

I. I NTRODUCTION

Lemma II.1. For every a ∈ Zn , the size sa of Sa divides m
which is the order of q modulo n.

Sa := {a · q i mod n : i = 0, 1, 2, . . . }.

One way to produce good quantum codes is to make use
of Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes [1]. To get -ary
quantum codes, one needs Hermitian self-orthogonal classical
codes over F 2 with good minimum distance of dual codes.
Due to the fact that the Hermitian inner product involves
power (see (IV.2)), the parameters of quantum codes derived
from Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes are usually
constrained. For instance, in [6] (also see [5]), quantum MDS
codes produced by using Hermitian self-orthogonal classical
codes have relatively small dimension.
In this paper, we ﬁrst go to a ﬁeld of larger size to obtain
classical codes over F 2 and then we select Hermitian selforthogonal codes from these classical codes over F 2 . In this
way, we can produce good quantum codes. Our idea to produce
classical codes over F 2 from a ﬁeld of large size has already
been studied in the previous papers [2], [7], [8], [10], [11]
where polynomial codes were considered. The main idea of
this paper is to convert some of these codes into Hermitian
self-orthogonal in order to construct quantum codes. It turns
out that some new quantum codes can be produced (see
Examples V.5 and V.6).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce some basic notations and results about cyclotomic
cosets and corresponding polynomials. In Section III, we show
how classical codes can be constructed from these cosets and
polynomials. To construct quantum codes, we study dual codes
of these classical codes in Section IV. In the last section, we
apply the results in the previous sections to construction of
quantum codes.

Proof: It is clear that sa is the smallest positive integer
such that a ≡ aq sa mod n, i.e, sa is the smallest positive integer such that n/ gcd(n, a) divides q sa − 1. Since n/ gcd(n, a)
also divides q m − 1, we have m ≡ 0 mod sa by applying the
long division.
Now for each Sa , we form sa polynomials in the following
way. Let α1 , . . . , αsa be an Fq -basis of Fqsa (note that Fqsa
is a subﬁeld of Fqm ). Consider the polynomials fa,j (x) :=
i
sa −1
a q
for j = 1, 2, . . . , sa .
i=0 (αj x )
Lemma II.2. For every a ∈ Zn , we have the following facts.
(i) The polynomials fa,j (x) for j = 1, 2, . . . , sa are linearly
independent over Fq .
(ii) fa,j (β) belongs to Fq for all β ∈ Un ∪ {0}, where Un
is the subgroup of n-th roots of unity in F∗m , i.e., Un :=
q
{β ∈ F∗m : β n = 1}.
q
Proof: (i) is clear since the coefﬁcients of xa in fa,j (x)
are αj and α1 , α2 , . . . , αsa form an Fq -basis of Fqsa .
To prove (ii), it is sufﬁcient to prove that (fa,j (β))q =
fa,j (β) for every β ∈ Un ∪ {0}. Consider

III. C ONSTRUCTION OF CLASSICAL CODES

Let q be a prime power and let n > 1 be a positive integer
with gcd(q, n) = 1. Let m be the order of q modulo n, i.e, m
is the smallest positive integer such that n divides q m − 1.

In this section, we give a construction of classical codes
basing on the facts from Section 2. For a positive integer r

1

with 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1, consider the set of polynomials

in Example III.2, {1, 4, 13, 16} and {35, 38, 47, 50} are dual
to each other. It is clear that the dual of a given cyclotomic
coset is unique. Moreover, we have the following facts.

Pr := {fa,j (x) : 0 ≤ a ≤ r, j = 1, 2, . . . , sa }.
Denote the size of PK by kr . From Lemma II.2, it is clear that
the polynomial space Vr spanned by Pr over Fq has dimension
kr .
The code Cr is deﬁned by
{(f (β))β∈Un ∪{0} : f ∈ Vr }.

Lemma IV.1. Let Sa be the dual of a cyclotomic coset Sb .
Then we have
(i) |Sa | = |Sb |
(ii) For every x ∈ Sa , there exists y ∈ Sb such that x + y is
divisible by n.

(III.1)

Proposition III.1. The code Cr deﬁned in (III.1) is a q-ary
linear code with parameters [n + 1, kr , ≥ n + 1 − r].

Proof: We may assume that a + b is divisible by n. By
deﬁnition, sb is the smallest positive integer such that n divides
b(q sb − 1). Thus, sb is the smallest positive integer such that
n divides −b(q sb − 1). As −b(q sb − 1) ≡ a(q sb − 1) mod n,
the desired result of part (i) follows.
Let x ≡ aq i mod n for some integer i. By deﬁnition, there
exists c ∈ Sb such that a ≡ −c mod n. Thus, x ≡ aq i ≡
−cq i mod n. Put y = cq i mod n ∈ Sb . We obtain the desired
result of part (ii).
Consider a set S of cyclotomic cosets such that {0} ∈ S.
Let S ∗ denote the collection of duals of cyclotomic cosets in
S. We denote by PS the polynomial set

Proof: As the degree of every polynomial f (x) in Vr is at
most r ≤ n − 1, it has at most r roots. Thus, (f (β))β∈Un ∪{0}
has the Hamming weight at least n + 1 − r as long as f is a
nonzero polynomial. Hence, the dimension of Cr is the same
as the one of Vr , i.e., dim(Cr ) = kr . Moreover, the minimum
distance of Cr is at least n + 1 − r.
Example III.2. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Then the order of 4
modulo 51 is m = 4. All 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 51 are
{0}
{3, 12, 39, 48}
{7, 10, 28, 40}
{17}
{22, 31, 37, 46}

{19, 25, 43, 49}
{35, 38, 47, 50}

{fa,j (x) : Sa ∈ S; j = 1, 2, . . . , sa }.
Let VS be the Fq -space spanned by all polynomials in PS .
Deﬁne the Fq -linear code by

For instance, for r = 16, we obtain a 4-ary [52, 5, ≥ 36]-linear
code. This is an optimal code in the sense that for given length
and dimension, the minimum distance can not be improved.
For r = 17, we obtain a 4-ary [52, 6, ≥ 35]-linear code which
is best known based on the online table [4].

CS := {(f (β))β∈Un ∪{0} : f ∈ VS }
Then we have the following result.

Proposition IV.2. Let A = ∪t Sai be the set of all qi=1
cyclotomic cosets modulo n. Then the Euclidean dual of CS
is CR , where R = {{0}} ∪ (A − S ∗ ).

Example III.3. Let q = 4 and n = 63. Then the order of 4
modulo 63 is m = 3. All 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 63 are
{0}
{3, 12, 48}
{7, 28, 49}
{11, 44, 50}
{15, 51, 60}
{23, 29, 53}

{5, 17, 20}
{9, 18, 36}

{14, 35, 56}
{22, 25, 37}
{27, 45, 54}
{47, 59, 62}

Proof: First of all, the dimension of the code CS is
S∈S |S|. Thus, the dimension of CR is 1 +
S∈A |S| −
|T | = n+1−dim(CS ) (note the fact that S∈A |S| =
T ∈S
|Zn | = n). To prove our lemma, it is sufﬁcient to show that
every codeword in CS is orthogonal to all codewords of CR
under the dot product.
For a polynomial u(x) in PA , we denote by cu the codeword
(u(β))β∈Un ∪{0} . Let f (x), g(x) be polynomials in PS and
PR , respectively. If both f (x) and g(x) are equal to 1. Then
cf = cg is the all-one vector 1. It is clear that in this case cf
and cg are orthogonal under the dot product. Now assume that
at least one of f (x), g(x) is not equal to 1. Then for any terms
xi in f (x) and terms xj in g(x), we have i + j ≡ 0 mod n.
Thus, the product f (x)g(x) contains only terms xk with k ≡
0 mod n. For such k we have

For instance, for r = 16, we get a 4-ary [64, 4, ≥ 48]-linear
code. This is an optimal code in the sense that for given length
and dimension, the minimum distance can not be improved.
For r = 20, again we get an optimal 4-ary [64, 7, ≥ 44]-linear
code. For r = 21, an optimal 4-ary [64, 8, ≥ 43]-linear code
can be derived as well.
IV. D UAL CODES

βk =

In this section, we study dual codes for those codes arisen
from cyclotomic cosets. From now on, we assume that q is
even. Then n is always odd (as gcd(n, q) = 1) and hence
n + 1 is even.
Two q-cyclotomic cosets Sa and Sb are called dual if there
exists c ∈ Sb such that a + c is divisible by n. For instance,

β∈Un ∪{0}

αkn − 1
= 0,
αk − 1

where α is an n-th primitive root of unity in Un . This implies
that cf and cg are orthogonal under the dot product. The
desired result follows.

Example IV.3. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Let S =
{{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}}. By Example III.2, we know that R =
A − {{35, 38, 47, 50}}.

Example V.3. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Then
the order of 4 modulo 51 is m
=
4. Let
S = {{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}, {2, 8, 26, 32}, {6, 24, 27, 45}}. Then
2S = {{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}, {2, 8, 26, 32}, {3, 12, 39, 48}} and
(2S)∗ = {{0}, {35, 38, 47, 50}, {19, 25, 43, 49}, {3, 12, 39, 48}}.
Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0}} ∪ (A − (2S)∗ ). As
S47 , S48 , S49 and S50 belong to (2S)∗ , we obtain a binary
quantum [[52, 26, 6]] code which meets the best-known one
in the online table [4].
In the similar way, we obtain binary quantum codes with
parameters [[52, 24, 7]] and [[52, 8, 10]]. Both codes meet the
parameters of the best-known ones in [4].

In order to apply our results to quantum codes, we want to
discuss the Hermitian dual of CS as well. Let us assume that q
is equal to 2 . The Hermitian inner product of the two vectors
(u1 , u2 , . . . , un+1 ) and (v1 , v2 , . . . , vn+1 ) in Fn2 is deﬁned by
n+1

ui vi .

(IV.2)

i=1

By abuse of notations, for a set S = {Sa }a∈I of cyclotomic
cosets, we denote by S the set {Sa }a∈I of the cyclotomic
cosets .

Example V.4. Let q = 4 and n = 63. Then the order of 4
modulo 63 is m = 3.
(i) S = {{0}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 32}}. Then 2S = S and
(2S)∗ = {{0}, {31, 55, 61}, {47, 59, 62}}. Moreover, S
is contained in T = {{0}}∪(A − (2S)∗ ). As S61 and S62
belong to (2S)∗ , we obtain a binary quantum [[64, 50, 4]]
code which is optimal [4].
(ii) S = {{0}}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 32}, {6, 24, 33}}. Then
2S = {{0}}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 32}, {3, 12, 48}} and
(2S)∗ = {{0}, {15, 51, 60}{31, 55, 61}, {47, 59, 62}}.
Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0} ∪ (A − (2S)∗ ).
As S59 , S60 , S61 and S62 belong to (2S)∗ , we obtain a
binary quantum [[64, 44, 6]] code which is optimal again
[4].
Analogously, binary quantum codes with parameters
[[64, 38, 7]] and [[64, 32, 8]] can be derived. Both codes meet
the parameters of the best-known ones in [4].

Proposition IV.4. Under the inner product (IV.2), the Hermitian dual of CS is CT , where T = {{0}} ∪ (A − ( S)∗ ).
Proof: It is clear that the Hermitian dual of CS is the
Euclidean dual of C S . Now the desired result follows from
Proposition IV.2.
Example IV.5. Let q = 4 and n = 51. Let S =
{{0}, {1, 4, 13, 16}}. By Example III.2, we know that T =
A − {{19, 25, 43, 49}}.
V. A PPLICATION TO QUANTUM CODES
In this section, we show how to apply the results from the
previous sections to obtain quantum codes.
Instead of giving several complicated results with detailed
formula, we give a general result in this section. Then we use
examples to illustrate our result.

Example V.5. Let q
=
16 and n
=
51.
Then the order of 16 modulo 51 is m = 2.
Let S
=
{{0}, {12, 39}, {8, 26}, {4, 13}}. Then
4S = {{0}, {1, 16}, {2, 32}, {3, 48}} and (4S)∗ =
{{0}, {3, 48}, {19, 49}, {35, 50}}. Moreover, S is contained
in T = {{0}} ∪ (A − (2S)∗ ). As S50 , S49 and S48 belong to
(4S)∗ , we obtain a 4-ary quantum [[52, 38, 5]]-code.
Likewise, we obtain 4-ary quantum codes with parameters
[[52, 34, 6]], [[52, 30, 7]], [[52, 26, 8]], [[52, 22, 9]], [[52, 18, 10]]
and [[52, 14, 12]]. The last one meets the parameters of the
best-known ones in [3] and the rest are new to the online
table [3].

Theorem V.1. Let S be a set of q-cyclotomic cosets modulo
n and let T = {{0}} ∪ (A − ( S)∗ ) such that ( S)∗ contains
all cyclotomic cosets {Sa : n + 2 − d ≤ a ≤ n − 1}. If
S is a subset of T , then there exists an -ary quantum code
[[n + 1, n + 1 − 2k, ≥ d]], where k is the Fq -dimension of CS .
Proof: By Proposition IV.4, the Hermtian dual of CS is
CT . Under our assumption, CS is Hermitian self-orthogonal
under the inner product (IV.2). Thus, we obtain an -ary
quantum code [[n + 1, n + 1 − 2k]] with minimum distance at
least the Hamming distance of CT (see [1]). As PT contains
polynomials of degree at most n+1−d, the Hamming distance
of CT is at least d. This completes the proof.

Example V.6. Let q = 64 and n = 585. Then the order of 64
modulo 585 is m = 2. Let S = {{0}, {8, 512}, {16, 439}}.
Then 8S = {{0}, {1, 64}, {2, 128}} and (8S)∗ =
{{0}, {457, 583}, {521, 584}}. Moreover, S is contained in
T = {{0}}∪(A − (2S)∗ ). As S584 and S583 belong to (8S)∗ ,
we obtain a 8-ary quantum [[586, 576, 4]]-code.
In the similar way, we draw 8-ary quantum codes with
parameters [[586, 572, 5]], [[586, 568, 6]], [[586, 564, 7]],
[[586, 560, 8]], [[586, 556, 9]], [[586, 552, 10]], [[586, 548, 11]],
[[586, 544, 12]],
[[586, 540, 13]],
[[586, 536, 14]],
[[586, 532, 15]] and so on. Now, compared with the online
table [3], these codes have better parameters. For instance,
8-quantum codes with the parameters [[589, 553, 4]],

Example V.2. Let q = 4 and n = 21. Then the order of 4
modulo 21 is m = 3. All 4-cycloyomic cosets modulo 21 are
{0}
{3, 6, 12}
{9, 15, 18}

{1, 4, 16}}
{5, 17, 20}
{10, 13, 19}

{2, 8, 11}
{7}
{14}

Let S = {{0}, {1, 4, 16}, {2, 8, 11}, {3, 6, 12}}. Then 2S =
S and (2S)∗ = {{0}, {5, 17, 20}, {10, 13, 19}, {9, 15, 18}}.
Moreover, S is contained in T = {{0}} ∪ (A − (2S)∗ ). As
S17 , S18 , S19 and S20 belong to (2S)∗ , we obtain a binary
quantum [[22, 2, 6]] code which achieves the best-known parameters [4].

[[589, 513, 6]], [[627, 561, 5]], [[627, 531, 6]], [[627, 501, 7]],
[[629, 557, 6]], [[629, 533, 7]], [[629, 521, 8]] are given in [3].
We can see that with the same distances our codes have
bigger dimensions, but smaller lengths.
