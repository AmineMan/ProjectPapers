Recently, Wu and Verd´ have studied the information rates
u
that are achievable over the Gaussian channel when the input
takes value in a ﬁnite constellation with N signal points [9].
For every ﬁxed SNR, they show that the difference between
the capacity and the achievable rate tends to zero exponentially
in N. For the optimal constellation, the peak-to-average-power
ratio grows linearly with N, inducing no capacity loss. This
is in contrast to the constellations considered by Ungerboeck
[2] and Ozarow and Wyner [3], which have a ﬁnite peak-toaverage-power ratio.
In this work, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective
to study the capacity loss incurred by signal constellations with
a bounded support over the Gaussian channel for sufﬁciently
small noise variance. In particular, we use the duality-based
upper bound to the mutual information in [10] to provide a
lower bound on the capacity loss. The results are valid for both
peak- and average-power constraints and generalize directly
to other additive-noise channel models. For sufﬁciently high
SNR, our results recover the power loss of 1.53dB for square
signal constellations without invoking geometrical arguments.

Abstract—We determine the loss in capacity incurred by
using signal constellations with a bounded support over general
complex-valued additive-noise channels for suitably high signalto-noise ratio. Our expression for the capacity loss recovers the
power loss of 1.53dB for square signal constellations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
As it is well known, the channel capacity of the complexvalued Gaussian channel with input power at most P and noise
variance σ 2 is given by [1]
CG (P, σ) = log 1 +

P
σ2

.

(1)

Although inputs distributed according to the Gaussian distribution attain the capacity, they suffer from several drawbacks
which prevent them from being used in practical systems.
Among them, especially relevant are the unbounded support
and the inﬁnite number of bits needed to represent signal
points.
In practice, discrete distributions with a bounded support
are typically preferred—in this case, the number of points
is allowed to grow with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Ungerboeck computed the rates that are achievable over the
Gaussian channel when the channel input takes value in a
ﬁnite constellation [2]. He observed that, when transmitting
at a rate of R bits per channel use, there is not much to
be gained from using constellations with size N larger than
2R+1 . Ozarow and Wyner provided an analytic conﬁrmation
of Ungerboeck’s observation by deriving a lower bound on the
rates achievable with ﬁnite constellations [3]. In both works,
the channel inputs are assumed to be uniformly distributed on
a lattice within some enclosing boundary, where the size of
the boundary is scaled in order to ensure unit input-power.
A related line of work considered signal constellations
with favorable geometric properties, e.g., minimum Euclidean
distance or minimum average error probability. For signal
constellations with a large number of points, i.e., dense constellations, Forney et al. [4] estimated the loss in SNR with
respect to the Gaussian input to be 10 log10 πe ≈ 1.53dB by
6
comparing the volume of an n-dimensional hypercube with
that of an n-dimensional hypersphere of identical average
power. Later, Ungerboeck’s work led to the study of multidimensional constellations based on lattices [5]–[8].

II. C HANNEL M ODEL AND C APACITY
We consider a discrete-time, complex-valued additive noise
channel, where the channel output Yk at time k ∈ Z (where
Z denotes the set of integers) corresponding to the time-k
channel input xk is given by
Yk = xk + σWk ,

k ∈ Z.

(2)

We assume that {Wk , k ∈ Z} is a sequence of independent
and identically distributed, centered, unit-variance, complex
random variables of ﬁnite differential entropy. We further
assume that the distribution of Wk does neither depend on
σ > 0 nor on the sequence of channel inputs {xk , k ∈ Z}.
The channel inputs take value in the set S, which is assumed
to be a bounded Borel subset of the complex numbers C. We
further assume that S has positive Lebesgue measure and that
0 ∈ S.
The set S can be viewed as the region that limits the signal
points. For example, for a square signal constellation, it is a
square:
S

{x ∈ C : − A ≤ Re (x) ≤ A, −A ≤ Im (x) ≤ A} (3)

for some A > 0. Here Re (x) and Im (x) denote the real
and imaginary part of x, respectively. Similarly, for a circular
signal constellation,

The research leading to these results has received funding from the
European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)
under grant agreement No. 252663 and from the European Research Council
under ERC grant agreement 259663.

We study the capacity of the above channel under an
average-power constraint P on the inputs. Since the channel
is memoryless, it follows that the capacity CS (P, σ) (in nats
per channel use) is given by
CS (P, σ) =

sup
X∈S,E[|X|2 ]≤P

I(X; Y )

which together with (9) yields (10).
Let PU denote the average power of a random variable that
is uniformly distributed over S, i.e.,

which follows from the behavior of differential entropy under

random variables yields then that, for every E |X|2 < ∞ and
E |W |2 < ∞, the ﬁrst differential entropy on the right-hand
side (RHS) of (11) satisﬁes

Specializing (18) to a square signal constellation (3) yields

which corresponds to a power loss of roughly 1.53dB. Hence,
we recover the rule of thumb that “square signal constellations
have a 1.53dB power loss at high signal-to-noise ratio.”
For a circular signal constellation (4), the upper bound (18)
becomes (irrespective of R)
e
(20)
L• ≤ log

recovering the power loss of 1.33dB [4].
The inequality in (17) holds with equality if the capacityachieving input-distribution does not depend on σ, cf. (13).
However, this is in general not the case. For example, for
circularly-symmetric Gaussian noise and a circular signal
constellation (4), it was shown by Shamai and Bar-David [13]
that, for every σ > 0, the capacity-achieving input-distribution
is discrete in magnitude, with the number of mass points
growing with vanishing σ. Nevertheless, the following theorem
demonstrates that the RHS of (17) is indeed the capacity loss.
Theorem 1 (Main Result): For the above channel model,
we have

(9)

Indeed, we have

lim h(X + σW ) = h(X).

(16)

For P = PU (and hence λ = 0), this becomes

By choosing an input distribution that does not depend on

entropy.) The capacity loss (6) can thus be written as

A small modiﬁcation of the proof in [12, Th. 12.1.1] shows
that the density that maximizes h(X) for X ∈ S with
probability one and E |X|2 ≤ P has the form

where the supremum is over all input distributions with
essential support in S that satisfy E |X|2 ≤ P.
We focus on CS (P, σ) in the limit as the noise variance σ
tends to zero. In particular, we study the capacity loss, which

for P ≥ PU and satisﬁes (16) for P < PU . Some useful
properties of K ,σ are summarized in the following lemma.
Lemma 2: The normalizing constant K ,σ satisﬁes

Note 1: It is not difﬁcult to adapt the proof of Theorem 1
to other regions S and moment constraints. For example, the
same proof technique can be used to derive the capacity loss
when S is a Borel subset of the real numbers and the channel
input’s ﬁrst-moment is limited, i.e., E[|X|] ≤ A.
Equations (11)–(13) demonstrate that the capacity loss (21)
can be achieved with a continuous-valued channel input having density f (·). Using the lower-semicontinuity of relative
entropy [14], it can be further shown that (21) can also be
achieved by any sequence of discrete channel inputs {XN }

Gauss-Hermite quadratures [16], as described for example
in [17, Sec. III]. Since for a ﬁxed m the information rate
corresponding to 2m -ary QAM is bounded by m bits, the
rate loss of 2m -ary QAM tends to inﬁnity as σ tends to
zero. We observe that the lower bound on L(σ) converges to
L = log(πe/6) ≈ 0.353 as σ tends to zero, but is rather loose
for ﬁnite σ. However, in the proof of Theorem 1 we chose the
density (25) to decay sufﬁciently slowly, so as to ensure that
the lower bound on L holds for every unit-variance noise of
ﬁnite differential entropy. For Gaussian noise, a density can be
chosen that decays much faster, giving rise to a tighter bound.

(where tan−1 (·) denotes the arctangent function), and by using
(35) together with the fact that ξ → −ξ log ξ is monotonically
increasing for ξ ≤ e−1 and that −ξ log ξ ≤ 1/e for 0 < ξ < 1,
we obtain, upon minimizing over > 0,

This together with (48) yields a lower bound on L(σ).
Figure 1 shows the lower bound on L(σ) for circularlysymmetric Gaussian noise and a square signal constellation
(3) with P = PU . It further shows the information-rate
losses of 2m -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) for
m = 10, 16, and 22, which were numerically obtained using
