Abstract—We formulate a model for intermittent communications that can capture bursty transmissions or a sporadically
available channel, where in either case the receiver does not
know a priori when the transmissions occur. Focusing on the
point-to-point case, we develop two decoding schemes and their
achievable rates for such communication scenarios. One scheme
determines the transmitted codeword, and another scheme ﬁrst
locates the information symbols and then uses them to decode.
The two-stage scheme leads to a higher achievable rate because
it uses a generalization of the method of types in the ﬁrst stage,
which leads to a notion of partial divergence. We illustrate the
results in the case of an intermittent binary symmetric channel.

System model for intermittent communication.

After formulating the problem and speciﬁcally mentioning
the applications, we describe the ﬁrst decoding scheme and
analyze its achievable rate. Then, we consider a two-stage
decoding procedure and characterize its achievable rate using a
notion of partial divergence that results from a generalization
of the method of types. Finally, we illustrate the achievable
rates for an intermittent binary symmetric channel (BSC).

I. I NTRODUCTION
Communication systems are traditionally analyzed assuming continuous transmission of encoded symbols through the
channel. However, in many practical applications such an
assumption is not appropriate, and transmitting a codeword
can be intermittent due to lack of synchronization, shortage of
transmission energy, or burstiness of the system. The challenge
is that the receiver does not explicitly know whether a given
output symbol of the channel is a result of sending a symbol
of the codeword or is simply a noise symbol containing no
information about the message. In this paper, we model such
intermittent communication and determine some achievable
rates.
Asynchronous communication is modeled in [1] and [2]
by a single block transmission that starts at a random time,
unknown to the receiver, in an exponentially large window,
known to the receiver. In this model, the transmission is
contiguous; once it starts, the whole codeword is transmitted,
and the receiver observes only noise before and after transmission. However, in intermittent communication, a codeword is
not transmitted contiguously. Instead, some number of noise
symbols occur between the symbols of a codeword before
going through the channel. We assume that the receive window
and the codewords length, and therefore the number of inserted
noise symbols, is ﬁxed. In contrast to [1], where the interesting
scenario arises if the receive window scales exponentially with
the codeword length, the interesting scenario in intermittent
communication arises if the receiver window scales linearly
with the codeword length. Our system model can be also
interpreted as an insertion channel, in which a random number
of noise symbols is inserted between consecutive symbols of
the codeword. Although different from the insertion channels
in the literature [3] and [4], our results may provide some
insights about them.

II. M ODEL , A PPLICATIONS , AND N OTATIONS
A transmitter wants to send a message m ∈ {1, 2, ..., ekR =
M } to a receiver through a discrete memoryless channel. Let
X and Y denote the input and output alphabets of the channel,
and let W denote its probability transition matrix. Assume
that {ck (m), m = 1, 2, ..., M } are the codewords of integer
length k available to the transmitter, and let X n and Y n denote
the integer length n input and output vectors of the channel,
respectively, where n ≥ k, and α := n/k, α ≥ 1. Assume that
X n consists of the transmitted codeword at k arbitrary time
slots and is equal to a noise symbol denoted by ∈ X at the
other n − k time slots, where the codeword ck appears in the
sequence X n in the same order, i.e., ci cannot appear after
cj in the sequence if i ≤ j. It is equivalent to say that n − k
noise symbols are arbitrarily inserted between the symbols
of a codeword. Figure 1 shows a block diagram for the
system model, which we call intermittent communication and
denote by (X, Y, W, , α). The communication rate is deﬁned
as log M/k. Assuming that the decoded message is denoted by
m, we say that rate R is achievable if there exists a sequence
ˆ
M
1
ˆ
of length k codes of size ekR with M m=1 P(m = m) → 0
as k → ∞. The capacity is the supremum of all the achievable
rates. A natural question is, what is the capacity of intermittent
communication? In this paper, we ﬁnd some achievable rates.
The intermittent communication model can also represent
bursty communication in which either the transmitter or the
channel is bursty. We assume that the receiver does not know
the positions of the codeword symbols in the channel input

more simply TP is the set of all sequences that have type P .
We use PX to denote the set of distributions over the ﬁnite
alphabet X. For simplicity, we deﬁne W (·) := W (·|x = ).
In this paper, we use the convention that n = 0 if k < 0 or
k
n < k, and the entropy H(P ) = −∞ if P is not a probability
mass function, i.e., one of its elements is negative or the sum
of its elements is larger than one. h(·) is the binary entropy
function. Finally, if 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1, then ρ := 1 − ρ.

sequence. As we will see, this natural assumption seems to
make the decoder’s task more difﬁcult. We also assume that
the transmitter cannot decide on these positions, so it cannot
encode any timing information. Note that in a bursty communication scenario, the process of burstiness is usually out
of the transmitter’s control, and the receiver usually does not
know the realization of the bursts, which are consistent with
these assumptions. The level of intermittency (or burstiness)
is controlled by how large n is compared to k. The larger
the value of α, the more intermittent the system is; if α = 1,
the system is not intermittent and corresponds to contiguous
communication. Not surprisingly, the achievable rates obtained
in this paper are a function of α: increasing α generally
reduces the achievable rates.
The described system model applies to several practical
communication scenarios. If the intermittent process component in Figure 1 is considered as a part of the channel behavior,
then we say that the channel is intermittent in the sense that it
takes a symbol of the codeword as an input at some time slots,
and takes a noise symbol as an input at other time slots. As
an example, consider an insertion channel in which, after the
ith symbol from the codeword, Ni noise symbols are inserted,
where Ni ’s are i.i.d. random variables with mean α−1. At the
decoder, there are N symbols, where N is a random variable,
but we have

III. M AIN R ESULTS
We ﬁrst introduce a simple decoding scheme, obtaining an
achievable rate (Proposition 1) in addition to providing some
ingredients for obtaining an achievable rate for a two stage
decoding scheme (Theorem 1).
A. One-Stage Decoding
For a ﬁxed input distribution P , the codebook is randomly and independently generated, i.e., all Ci (m), i ∈
{1, 2, ..., k}, m ∈ {1, 2, ..., M } are i.i.d. according to P . For a
ﬁxed typicality parameter µ > 0, the decoder observes the
sequence y n , chooses k symbols out of those n symbols,
denoted by y k , and performs joint typicality decoding, i.e.,
˜
checks if
ˆ

|Pck (m),˜k (x, y) − Pm (x, y)| ≤ µ

for all (x, y) ∈ X × Y and a unique index m, where Pm
is the joint probability mass function induced by the type of
codeword ck (m) and the channel W , deﬁned by [1]

Pm (x, y) := Pck (m) (x)W (y|x), (x, y) ∈ X × Y.

It turns out that the achievability results in the sequel are
valid for such insertion channels, as we discuss in more detail
in Section IV. Note that this is a speciﬁc class of insertion
channels, and we refer the interested reader to See [3], [4]
for more general classes of insertion channels and associated
results.
On the other hand, if the intermittent process component
in Figure 1 is considered as a part of the transmitter, then
we say that the transmitter is intermittent. Practical examples
are energy harvesting systems, where the transmitter harvests
energy usually from a natural source and uses it for transmission. Assuming that the noise symbol can be transmitted with
zero energy, the transmitter sends the symbols of the codeword
if there is enough energy for transmission, and sends noise
symbols otherwise. If the transmitter can store energy in an
energy buffer with enough capacity, then it can decide when
to send the symbols of the codeword and when to transmit a
noise symbol to save some energy based on the amount of the
available energy. In that case, the transmitter can also encode
some timing information, which is beyond the scope of this
paper.
Notation: We use o(·) to denote quantities that grow strictly
slower than their arguments. Most of the notation in this
paper follows that in [1] and [5]. By X ∼ P (x), we mean
X is distributed as P . The empirical distribution (or type)
ˆ
of a sequence xn ∈ Xn is denoted by Pxn . Joint empirical
distributions are denoted similarly. We say a sequence xn has
n

type P if Pxn = P and denote it by xn ∈ TP , where TP or

For convenience, we write y k ∈ T[W ]µ (ck (m)), if (1) is
˜
satisﬁed for m. If the decoder ﬁnds a unique m satisfying (1),
it declares m as the transmitted message. Otherwise, it makes
another choice for the k symbols from the sequence y n and
again attempts typicality decoding. If at the end of all n
k
choices the typicality decoding procedure did not declare any
message, then the decoder declares an error. In order to analyze
the probability of error, we state the following fact, which is
proved in [1, Equations (24) and (25)] based on the method
of types [5, Chapter 1.2].
˜
Fact 1. Assume that C k (m) and Y k are independent,
C k (m) is generated i.i.d. according to P , and (X, Y ) ∼
P (x)W (y|x), then the probability that C k (m) together with
˜
Y k satisfy (1) for this speciﬁc m, is upper bounded as

small by choosing a small enough typicality parameter µ.
Proposition 1. For intermittent communication with
(X, Y, W, , α), rates not exceeding C − αh(1/α) are
achievable, where C is the capacity of the DMC with
stochastic matrix W .
Proof: Let P be the capacity achieving input distribution
for the DMC with stochastic matrix W , and consider the
encoding and decoding strategies described above. For any

decoding ends. If the decoder does not declare any message
as being sent by the end of all n choices, then the declares
k
an error.
In order to analyze the probability of error, we need to
generalize the method of types in [5] to be able to bound the
probability of certain events in the ﬁrst stage of the two-stage
decoding procedure. To that end, we establish Lemma 1, which
is a generalization of [5, Lemma 2.6].

output symbols are the correct ones, which vanishes as k → ∞
according to [5, Lemma 2.12]. Using the union bound for the

Lemma 1. Consider an alphabet with t symbols, i.e., X =
{0, 1, ..., t − 1}. Consider three distributions P, Q, Q ∈ PX ,
where P := (p0 , p1 , ..., pt−1 ), Q := (q0 , q1 , ..., qt−1 ), and
Q := (q0 , q1 , ..., qt−1 ). We assume that all of the elements
of these three PMF’s are nonzero. A random sequence X k
is generated as follows: k1 symbols are i.i.d. according to Q
and k2 symbols are i.i.d. according to Q , where k1 + k2 = k
and ρ := k1 /k. The probability that X k has type P is upper
bounded as

Note that the maximum probability of error vanishes as
well using standard expurgation arguments. The form of the
achievable rate is reminiscent of communications overhead as
the cost of constraints [6], where the constraint is the system’s
burstiness, and the overhead cost is αh(1/α).

).

Because of space limitations, we prove the lemma for
the case of binary alphabets, i.e, t = 2, in Appendix A.
The generalization to t > 2 is straightforward, but lengthy.
Specializing Lemma 1 for Q = Q results in [5, Lemma 2.6],
and we have d(P, Q, Q, ρ) = D(P ||Q). Lemma 1 enables
us to evaluate the probability that a sequence consisting of
symbols from two different distributions has a speciﬁc type
P , which will be useful in proving the result in Theorem 1.
Basically, we are interested in a special case of Lemma 1
for which Q = P . In other words, we need to upper bound
the probability that a sequence has type P when partially
generated according to Q and partially according to P , where
the ratio of the mismatched symbols (generated from Q) to
all the symbols is ρ = k1 /k. For this special case, we deﬁne
dρ (P ||Q) := d(P, Q, P, ρ). The function dρ (P ||Q), which we
call partial divergence between P and Q, has some interesting
properties (such as 0 ≤ dρ (P ||Q) ≤ ρD(P ||Q)), on which we
will elaborate in another paper.

B. Two-Stage Decoding
In this section, we introduce a two-stage decoding procedure
that strictly improves upon the achievable rate in Proposition 1.
As before, the decoder chooses k of the n symbols from the
output vector y n . Let y k denote the chosen output symbols,
˜
and y n−k denote the other output symbols. The ﬁrst stage
ˆ
consists of checking if y k is the transmitted sequence (if y k ∈
˜
˜
TP W ), and if y n−k is generated by noise (if y n−k ∈ TW ).
ˆ
ˆ
If both of these conditions are satisﬁed, then we perform the
typicality decoding as described in Section III-A, which is
called the second stage here. Otherwise, we make another
choice for the k symbols and repeat the two-stage decoding
procedure. At any step that we run the second stage, if the
typicality decoding declares a message as being sent, then

To that end, let β := k1 /(n − k) (0 ≤ β ≤ 1), using Stirling’s
approximation as in (5) for each of the combinatorial terms
in (17), we ﬁnd that the largest exponent is f (P, W, α), which
is deﬁned in (10); and where (19) is obtained by substituting
R = I(X; Y ) − f (P, W, α) − 2 . Now, combining (11), (13),
and (19), we have pavg → 0 as k → ∞, which proves the

Theorem.
IV. E XAMPLE : BSC
Consider a BSC with crossover probability 0 ≤ p ≤ 0.5.
Figure 2 shows the two achievable rates obtained in Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 versus p for different values of α ≥ 1.
Not surprisingly, the achievable rate in Theorem 1 (indicated
by “Thm 1”) is always larger than the one in Proposition 1
(indicated by “Prop 1”) since the two-stage decoding procedure takes advantage of the fact that the choice of the k output
symbols might not be a good one. Speciﬁcally, the exponent
obtained in Lemma 7 in terms of the partial divergence helps
the decoder detect the right symbols, and therefore, achieve a
larger rate. The arrows in Figure 2 show this difference and
suggests that the beneﬁt of using the two-stage decoding is
larger for increasing α. Note that the larger α is, the smaller
the achievable rate would be for a ﬁxed p. Also, note that as
p → 0 the achievable rates approach a limit, which is equal

where Y is the output of the channel if the input is C (1),
and Y is the output of the channel if the input is the noise
symbol, and where we use union bound to establish (12). The
limit (13) is because all the three terms in (12) vanish as k →
∞ according to [5, Lemma 2.12].
The ﬁrst term in (11) is more challenging. It is the probability that for at least one choices of the output symbols, the
decoder passes the ﬁrst stage and then the typicality decoder
declares an incorrect message. Let the index k i denote the
condition on the ith choice of the output symbols out of all n
k
choices. We characterize the choices based on the number of
incorrectly chosen output symbols, i.e., the number of symbols
in y k that are in fact outputs corresponding to a noise input,
˜
which is equal to the number of symbols in y n−k that are in
ˆ
fact outputs corresponding to an input symbol of the codeword.
Let the index k1 denote the condition that the number of
wrongly chosen output symbols is equal to k1 . For a speciﬁc
k
k1 there are k1 n−k choices (According to Vandermonde’s
k1
identity, we have n−k (kk1 )(n−k)=(n)). Using the union bound

two terms in (15) and using Fact 1 for the last term in (15),
because conditioned on message m = 1 being sent, C k (2)

the last term. Substituting (16) into the summation in (14), we

achieve a positive rate if α ≥ 2, even for the case of a noiseless
channel (p = 0). However, this is not true in general, because
even the ﬁrst achievable rate can be positive for a large α, if
the capacity of the channel is sufﬁciently large. Figure 3 can
be interpreted as the achievable region for (R, α). The results
suggest that, as communication becomes more intermittent
and α becomes larger, the achievable rate is decreased due to
the additional uncertainty in the positions of the information
symbols at the decoder.

to 1 − αh( α ) (bits/s) for the ﬁrst achievable rate. However, it
is more involved to obtain it for the second achievable rate,
which is denoted by RInsertion and can be proven to be equal to
max0≤p0 ≤1 {2h(p0 )−max0≤β≤1 {(α−1)h(β)+h((α−1)β)+
(1−(α−1)β)h( p0 −(α−1)β )}}. Note that this is the achievable
1−(α−1)β
rate if the channel is noiseless (p = 0), which models the
insertion channel we discussed in Section II.
Figure 3, shows the value of RInsertion and the value of
achievable rates for different p, versus α. Not surprisingly,
as α → 1, the capacity of the BSC is approach for both of the
achievable rates. Again, the difference between the achievable
