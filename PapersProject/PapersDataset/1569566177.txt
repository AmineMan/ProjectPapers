the left regular representation typically employed in the area
[1]. While codes arising from a division algebra are no novelty,
the iterative nature of this construction endows the resulting
codes with fast-decodable properties. This is achieved using a
scaling technique, which allows us to preserve fast-decodable
properties of the initial code throughout the iterative process.
The sketch of our construction is as follows. Let D be a
division algebra contained in the ring M atn×n (K) of n × n
matrices with coefﬁcients in a number ﬁeld K (in this context,
the property of being division means that every matrix in
D is invertible). We provide a general construction which
allows us to embed the algebra D into a bigger algebra
A = A(D) ⊂ M at2n×2n (K). Given that the initial algebra D
was division, a criterion decides when the algebra A is also
division. The process can thus be repeated, starting with A(D)
instead of D to construct a sequence of division algebras,
whose elements are matrices with coefﬁcients in K. At each
stage of the iteration, a new fully-diverse space-time code is
derived from the corresponding division algebra.

Abstract—We present an iterative construction of algebraic
space-time codes. Starting from a division algebra D, we show
how to embed it into a larger ring A = A(D) and give conditions
for A to be a new division algebra. Starting from a quaternion
division algebra D1 , we thus obtain a sequence D1 ⊂ D2 ⊂ . . .
of division algebras where Di = A(Di−1 ). Each of the Di can
be used as an underlying structure to build a space-time Ci .
Furthermore, the iteration step is done such that fast-decodability
of the original code is preserved. We illustrate our technique by
creating an iterative version of the Silver code.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Space-time codes arising from division algebras [1] have
been used for several years and many codes with good
performance are available. While supplying full diversity, these
codes also possess a lattice structure which incurs a high
complexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding, typically
implemented with a sphere decoder [2]. A line of research on
fast-decodable codes initiated in [3] yielded several families of
codes with reduced ML decoding complexity, notably in [4]–
[6], where different notions of fast-decodability are studied
and categorized. Codes for the Multiple Input Double Output
(MIDO) channel have been of special interest due to their
potential application to digital video broadcasting, where the
number of receive antennas is limited by the size of the
user’s portable device. In particular, several constructions of
fast-decodable MIDO codes have been proposed [7]–[9]. Sequences of fast-decodable codes when the number of transmit
antennas increases can be found in [10].
In this paper, we are similarly interested in addressing the
design of fast-decodable codes for possibly large number of
transmit antennas, and present an iterative construction of
minimum delay algebraic space-time codes - generalizing the
method proposed in [11] - which generates for each i ≥ 1 a
family of fast-decodable full-rate MIDO 2i × 2i codes.
Each code in this family is a full-rate MIDO code contained
in the ring of 2i × 2i matrices M at2i ×2i (K) with coefﬁcients
in a number ﬁeld K. At each step of the iteration, the resulting
space-time code actually carries an algebra structure, and we
supply criteria which determine when this algebra is division,
or alternatively put, when the code is fully diverse. It is worth
highlighting that the matrix representation of these codes is not

II. S YSTEM M ODEL AND FAST D ECODABILITY
For each integer i ≥ 1, let T = 2i denote the number of Tx
antennas. We consider transmission over a coherent Rayleigh
fading channel with T Tx antennas, 2 Rx antennas and perfect
channel state information at the receiver (CSIR):
Y = HX + V,

(1)

where H is the 2 × T channel matrix, V is the 2 × T Gaussian
noise at the receiver, and X ∈ Ci is a T ×T codeword that can
be represented as a linear combination g1 B1 + · · · + gri Bri of
generating matrices B1 , . . . , Bri of the code Ci , weighted by
coefﬁcients g1 , . . . , gri , which are PAM information symbols.
The matrices B1 , . . . , Bri will sometimes be referred to as a
basis of the code Ci and ri as the rank of the code. For each
i ≥ 1, we construct a code Ci ⊂ M at2i ×2i (K), such that the
R-rank ri of each iterated code is 2i+2 . Since each codeword
can transmit up to 4T = 2i+2 PAM information symbols
(equivalently 2i+1 complex symbols), the resulting codes are
full-rate MIDO codes. Alternatively, in terms of number of
complex symbols per channel use (cspcu), the proposed codes
are of rate two for each i, which is maximal for a MIDO code.
Maximum-likelihood decoding amounts to searching the code

closest to the received matrix Y with respect to the squared
Frobenius norm. Each 2 × T matrix HBj corresponds, via
vectorization, to a vector bj ∈ Rri obtained by stacking the
columns followed by separating the real and imaginary parts
of HBj . We deﬁne the (generating) matrix

We start with a 4-dimensional algebra D1 , and obtain a
sequence D1 , D2 , D3 , . . . of division algebras with D1 ∈
M at2×2 (K), D2 ∈ M at4×4 (K), D3 ∈ M at8×8 (K), etc. For
i ≥ 1, the code Ci corresponding to Di is a subset of the matrix
ring M at2i ×2i (K) for some number ﬁeld K. A codeword in
Ci encodes 2i+2 real symbols (i.e., 4 real symbols pcu).

B = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bri ) ∈ Mri ×ri (R),
so every received codeword can be represented as a real vector
Bg, with g = (g1 , . . . , gri )T having coefﬁcients in the real
alphabet S in use, and ML decoding amounts to ﬁnding

A. The Algebraic Framework
We describe the general iterative step ﬁrst. Let K be a
number ﬁeld, and D be a division algebra contained in the
ring M atn×n (K) of n × n matrices over K (n is some 2i at
the ith iteration). Given an automorphism τ of K, we extend
it to a homomorphism of D (still denoted by τ by abuse of
notation) by pointwise action on K-coefﬁcients of elements
of D, i.e., for a matrix A ∈ D ⊂ M atn×n (K), we have

arg min{||y − Bg||2 }g∈S ri = arg min{||Q∗ y − Rg||2 }g∈S ri
E

with respect to the Euclidean norm, where y is the vectorization of Y , and R is an upper right triangular matrix obtained
through the QR decomposition B = QR, with Q unitary.
The number and position of nonzero elements in the upper
right part of R determine the complexity of the sphere decoding [3]: if ri is the number of independent real information
symbols from S within one codeword from Ci , then the ML
decoding complexity is the minimum number of values of g
used in (3) while performing ML decoding. The worst case,
when the matrix R is a full upper right triangular matrix, is
the complexity of the exhaustive-search ML decoder, that is
O(|S|ri ), where |S| is the number of PAM symbols in use.
Fast decodability is achieved whenever the code structure is
such that the decoding complexity has an exponent κi of |S|
smaller than ri . We call κi the complexity order of the code.
Given an ordered basis B1 , . . . , Bri , we can determine the
zero structure of R by the zero structure of the matrix M ,
deﬁned by orthogonality relations of the basis elements:

τ : (Aij ) → (τ (Aij )).
Note that τ (A)τ (B) = τ (AB), hence τ (A−1 ) = τ (A)−1 for
A invertible . In our construction τ will have to in fact be an
automorphism of D, i.e., satisfy τ (D) = D.
We next deﬁne a map αθ which embeds D × D into a
larger ring. Given an element θ of the center Z(D) of D, let
αθ : D × D → M at2×2 (D) be the map deﬁned by

which is seen as an embedding of D × D into M at2n×2n (K).
For this construction to be iterative, A := αθ (D, D) needs
to again be a division algebra. We start with a criterion which
determines when A has the structure of a Z(D)-algebra1 . The
question of whether it is division is discussed below.
Lemma 1: Let τ be an automorphism of K of order 2,
which extends to an automorphism of D and ﬁxes its center
pointwise, i.e., τ (z) = z for z ∈ Z(D). If θ ∈ Z(D), then
the image A of αθ forms an algebra of dimension 2d2 over
Z(D), where d2 is the dimension of D over its center.
Proof: Note that A = αθ (D, D) is both additively and
multiplicatively closed, since clearly

is generally only a subset of Z(A).

using that τ (θ) = θ, since τ ∈ Z(D), and τ 2 = 1. The center
of D embeds into the center of A via
z → αθ (z, 0) =

where τ : a → − a is a Galois F -automorphism, b ∈ F
and c, d ∈ K. The code C1 consists of the subset of D1 , whose
coefﬁcients c, d are algebraic integers of K. When F is an
imaginary quadratic of Q, each symbol from F corresponds
to 2 rational symbols. Hence each codeword carries 2 Ksymbols, that is 4 F -symbols, or 8 Q-symbols. The rank r1
of the code C1 is hence 8. Restricting the symbols in F to be
algebraic integers means that the 8 Q-symbols are in Z.
First we note that τ is of order 2, and extends to an
automorphism of D1 :

Since A is additionally a vector space over Z(D), it has the
structure of a Z(D)-algebra. It is of dimension 2d2 over Z(D).
We now give a criterion on θ which guarantees that the
Z(D)-algebra A = αθ (D, D) is division, in other words every
nonzero element of A is invertible. The following lemma is a
slight generalization of [11, Lemma 1].
Lemma 2: Let D be a division algebra, whose elements
correspond to n × n matrices over a ﬁeld K. Let τ and θ
satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 1. Then A = αθ (D, D) is
division if and only if θ = zτ (z) for all z ∈ D.
Proof: Suppose that θ = zτ (z) for all z ∈ D. We will
show that A is division. Consider a nonzero element
αθ (x, y) =

where A, B ∈ D1 and θ2 is an element of F , possibly equal to θ1 . Continuing, we obtain an iterative sequence of algebras Di = αθi−1 (Di−1 , Di−1 ), whose elements
are in M at2i ×2i (K). The corresponding codes are Ci =
αθi−1 (Ci−1 , Ci−1 ). From Lemma 2, θi , i ≥ 1 must satisfy

det(z) det(τ (z) − In z −1 θ)
det(z) det(τ (z) − In z −1 zτ (z))

=

τ (c) bτ (τ (d))
τ (c) bd

τ (d) τ (τ (c))
τ (d) c

The code C2 is obtained as the image αθ1 (C1 , C1 ) of C1 .
Similarly, the second step gives the algebra D2 whose elements
are 8 × 8 matrices of the form

It thus sufﬁces to demonstrate τ (x)−yx−1 θτ (y) = 0. Since y
is invertible, and recalling that for x ∈ D, τ (x−1 ) = τ (x)−1 ,
the latter inequality is equivalent to xy −1 τ (xy −1 ) = θ. Letting
z = xy −1 , by our assumption on θ, we have θ = zτ (z). Hence
det(αθ (x, y)) = 0.
Conversely, suppose θ = zτ (z) for some z ∈ D. We verify
that det(αθ (z, In )) = 0, where In is the identity matrix.
Indeed

=

Indeed, this is an element of D1 since τ (θ1 ) = θ1 . The ﬁrst
step of the iteration gives us the algebra D2 = αθ (D1 , D1 )
whose elements are matrices of the form


d

is in D1 , since τ (b) = b. Adding that τ (z) = z for every
z ∈ Z(D1 ) = F , we can use it for the iterative step in αθ .
Now for any θ1 ∈ Z(D1 ) = F , let θ1 also denote the matrix

θτ (y)
τ (x)

where the entries x, y are n × n matrices from the division
algebra D. If x = 0 (resp. y = 0), the matrix is clearly
invertible. Let us thus assume that both x, y ∈ D are nonzero,
hence invertible. The formula (sometimes referred to as Schur
complement) for the determinant of a block matrix gives
det

det(z) det(0) = 0.

θi = zτ (z), z ∈ Di .

Hence A is not division.

C. Scaling

B. The General Code Construction

We now deﬁne a scaled version αθ of the map αθ , which
˜
will be useful in constructing fast-decodable codes from the
iterated construction. Recall the map αθ deﬁned in (5):

Let us now detail how the above general iterative construction induces a family of space-time codes, by ﬁxing for the
ﬁrst step (i=1) an algebra D1 of dimension 4.
Let F be a number ﬁeld, and let D1 = (a, b)F be a
generalized quaternion algebra [12]. By deﬁnition, D1 is of
dimension 4 over its center F , and has for maximal subﬁeld

We denote by ζ a 4rth root of unity, it does not have to be

From the calculations above, we can see how the fast
decodable properties of the code C with underlying algebra
D are inherited by the iterated code coming from A(D), as
we summarize in the lemma below.
Lemma 1: Let D be a code with basis {D1 , . . . , Dr }. Then

the Silver code is obtained via left regular representation of
the elements of the natural order of the quaternion algebra

√
c, d ∈ Q( −7, i) we have a Silver codeword (10) arising
from D1 . The automorphism τ of order 2 extends to D1 via

Noting that τ (z) = z for every z ∈ Z(D1 ) = F , we can use
τ for the iterative construction.
Given θ1 ∈ Z(D1 ), the ﬁrst iteration D2 = αθ1 (D1 , D1 ) of
the Silver code is given by matrices looking like

The corresponding code built over the algebra A(D) thus
enjoys the same orthogonality relations, meaning that with
each iteration i the worst case increase in complexity order
is 2i . This gives the following (very) loose bound.
Corollary 1: Let Di be an iterated code with complexity
order κi . Then κi+1 ≤ 2i + κi .

To make the corresponding code C1 fully diverse, by Lemma

space-time codes, we show here that we can derive conditions
that generate a sequence of algebras, which can be division.
Furthermore, we explain how the bigger code can inherit fastdecodability properties from the smaller codes.
Future work involves a more thorough investigation of the
code parameters involved, as well as simulations to determine
which code instances are giving the best performance, in terms
of diversity, fast-decodability, and coding gain.

equality is satisﬁed only when d1 = 0. Thus assume d1 = 0,
in which case we need that cτ (c) − τ (d)2 = θ1 for d = id2 .
Write c = c1 + ic2 , this is equivalent to checking

with c1 , c2 , d2 ∈ F = Q(i 7). For example, θ = −17 satisﬁes
the two conditions above. Clearly, θ/−1 = 17 is not a square
in K. For the second condition, by reducing modulo the ideal
√
I = ( 1+ 2 −7 )3 OF , we see that θ ≡ −1 mod I, which we
verify is not a sum of three squares mod I.
By picking θ1 of the form a positive multiple of a 4rth
root of unity, D1 will inherit orthogonal relations from D1 ,
as explained in III-C. In fact, by being more restrictive and
picking θ1 to be of the form −θ with θ > 0, one can get a
better fast-decodability than what predicted in III-C, which is
what we illustrate now. In that case, the left upper part of the

showing that R is 4-group decodable, once half of the symbols
are decoding, showing a complexity order of κ2 = 10. Note
that this was already observed in the case of θ = −1 in [11],
though in this case the algebra cannot be division.
B. Second iteration
Let θ3 be an element of Z(D2 ). We can deﬁne the second
iteration D3 = αθ3 (D2 , D2 ), whose elements are 8×8 matrices
with entries in K of the form

where A, B are elements of D2 described in (11). To determine
whether D3 is division, Lemma 2 is applied similarly as in the
ﬁrst iteration. A minimum gain in fast-decodability is ensured
using the technique given in Subsection III-C, however, as
shown for the ﬁrst iteration, a more careful analysis could
reveal more than the minimal gain predicted.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a novel method to construct
space-time codes from division algebras, where instead of
using the classical left regular representation, we combine
space-time codes in small dimension in an iterative manner.
Techniques involving building codes from smaller ones have
