It is important to observe that although alternating sequences are generated by a Markov chain, their redundancy
cannot be accurately estimated using the methods developed
in [6]. This is due to the fact that the bound of [6] are
too general to give useful redundancy characterizations for
special classes of Markov chains. Surprisingly, the special
class of alternating Markov sequences has properties that
may be analyzed using tools developed for i.i.d. sequences,
with some appropriate modiﬁcations. Our analysis reveals that
alternating Markov chains have sub-linear pattern redundancy
√
in the sequence length n, scaling as c n + log(n), for some
constant c. This is a counterpart to the examples described
in [6], where Markov chains of redundancy of order n log n
were constructed using permutation patterns.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we
introduce the problem of distribution estimation over noisy
channels and the notion of alternating sequences. In Section
III, we review the basic ideas and terminology behind the
proposed estimation method, including the notions of patterns
and proﬁles. Sections IV-A and IV-B are devoted to deriving
upper and lower bounds on the redundancy of block estimators
for alternating sequences, respectively. A sequential estimator
for alternating sequences is presented in Section V. Section VI
describes how to determine the source distribution, observed
through a noisy channel, based on the estimated probabilities
of alternating sequences.
Due to space limitations, for a number of results the proofs
are either omitted or outlined only. The complete proofs may
be found in the archive version of the manuscript.

Abstract—We consider a class of small-sample distribution
estimators over noisy channels. Our estimators are designed for
repetition channels, and rely on properties of the runs of the
observed sequences. These runs are modeled via special types of
Markov chains, termed “alternating Markov chains”. We show
that alternating chains have redundancy that scales sub-linearly
with the lengths of the sequences, and describe how to use a
distribution estimator for alternating chains for the purpose of
distribution estimation over repetition channels.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Estimating the distribution of a source with a large alphabet
based on a small number of observations is a problem of signiﬁcant interest in molecular biology, neuroscience, physics,
statistics, and learning theory. In order to address this problem,
throughout the years a number of sophisticated estimators were
developed, including those by Good and Turing [1], [2] and
Orlitsky et al. [3], [4], to cite a few. The idea behind these
estimators is to use frequencies of symbol frequencies, rather
than simple frequency counts standardly used for Maximum
Likelihood (ML) estimation.
An additional problem in this estimation setting arises when
some of the observations are inaccurate. Since most known
distribution estimators are based on frequency counts, errors
that change these counts may have a signiﬁcant bearing on
the accuracy of the method. A particularly interesting case
is when the counts are changed by consecutive repetitions
of some symbols. In [5], we described a collection of distribution estimators, based on Expectation Maximization (EM),
both for channels with known and channels with unknown
repetition parameters. The focal point of the study was a
class of sequences, termed alternating sequences, generated
by a Markov chain of special topology. The goal of this work
is twofold. The ﬁrst goal is to establish a rigorous analytical framework for evaluating the redundancy of alternating
Markov chains. The second goal is to describe how to use
alternating sequence distribution estimators for distribution
estimation over repetition channels. In particular, we exhibit
block and sequential estimators for alternating sequences that
have vanishing redundancy and provide good quality estimates
in the presence of repetition errors.

II. S MALL -S AMPLE D ISTRIBUTION E STIMATION
Consider a sample sequence x generated by an i.i.d. source
S deﬁned over a large-cardinality alphabet A. Suppose that
the source S has distribution pS . The estimator observes an
erroneous version of x, denoted by y. The errors are modeled
as arising from a channel C with input x and output y. What are
the ultimate performance limits for estimating the distribution
of the source, given that the length of x is small compared to
|A| or comparable to |A|?
Estimating the distribution of a source based on a noise-free
short sequence x is a challenging task. ML estimators perform

1

n

poorly in this setting as they typically overestimate probabilities of seen symbols, while they underestimate probabilities of
unseen symbols. More appropriate solutions for this scenario
are due to Good and Turing [1], [2] and Orlitsky et al. [3],
[4].
There are two approaches one can follow to address an even
more difﬁcult family of problems, namely that of small-sample
distribution estimation in the presence of errors.
In one scenario, one may try to ﬁrst denoise the output
ˆ
sequence y, so as to obtain a reduced-noise estimate x of
ˆ
x, and then apply a small-sample distribution estimator to x.
ˆ depends on both y and pS , and thus one needs
Note that x
to estimate pS in order to estimate x and vice versa. This
“estimation loop” may be resolved via the use of iterative
methods that alternate in improving estimates for x and pS
(see our companion paper [5]). In another scenario, one may
try to ﬁrst estimate the distribution of y and then reconstruct
the distribution of x by “inversion” of the noisy channel. We
henceforth pursue the second line of reasoning.
The focal point of our inversion study is a special class
of Markov sequences that arise in the study of distribution
estimation over repetition channels. A repetition channel is a
channel which outputs several copies of each input symbol.
The number of copies is a random variable with a predetermined distribution of known or unknown parameters. One
important property of repetition channels is that they maintain
the identity and order of symbols in the sequence, and only
alter the symbols’ runlengths. As an example, the sequence
x =‘committee’ passed through a repetition channel may be
observed as y =‘ccommmiitttee’. The alternating sequence
of a sequence x, V (x), is a sequence obtained from x by
replacing each run of x by one single symbol. We refer to
V (x) = V (y) as the alternating sequence of x and denote it
by v. Note that v is a Markov sequence and its corresponding
Markov chain is referred to as an alternating Markov chain.
Throughout the rest of the paper, we reserve the symbol
N to denote the length of the source output x. We also use
m to denote the cardinality of the alphabet A, which may be
inﬁnite, and n to denote the length of the alternating sequence
v.

parts of size i is ϕi and i iϕi = n. In the example above,
ϕ = (2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) corresponds to an (unordered) partition
of 7 into two parts of size 1, one part of size 2, and one part
of size 3, i.e., 7=1+1+2+3. In the correspondence between
partitions and proﬁles, the number of parts of size µ equals
the number of symbols that appear µ times. The number of
partitions of n is denoted by p (n).
It is clear that ψ is the pattern of an alternating sequence v
of length n if and only if ψi = ψi+1 , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.
Let I n be the collection of i.i.d. distributions over length n
sequences. Consider a probability distribution p over A that
assigns probability 0 < ps ≤ 1 to s ∈ A. Then, the distribution
induced by p over An is denoted by pn and for all x ∈ An ,
it equals

pn (x) :=

Note that pn ∈ I n .

over patterns of length n. The set of all such induced distrin
butions is denoted by IΨ . We simply write p (x) and p ψ if
dropping the subscripts and superscripts causes no confusion.
Furthermore, p induces a probability distribution over alternating sequences of length n, which for v = v1 · · · vn takes
the form

The set of all such induced distributions is denoted by V n . The

and the set VΨ are deﬁned similarly to their unconstrained
sequence counterparts. Note that the family pV n (v) is Markovian.
A. Properties of Alternating Sequences
The ﬁrst issue we address is the relationship between the
length of the source sequence and the length of the corresponding alternating sequence. The following lemma will be
useful four our subsequent derivations.

Lemma 1. Assuming all symbol probabilities are smaller than
1/2, we have

so that with high probability, n ≥ N/2 − 8N ln N .

The pattern ψ = Ψ (x) of a sequence x is obtained by
replacing each symbol by its order of appearance in x. The
proﬁle of ψ of a pattern is a vector Φ(ψ) = (ϕ1 , · · · , ϕn ),
where ϕi is the number of symbols that appear i times in
ψ. We use the shorthand notation Φ(x) to denote Φ(Ψ(x)).
Notational confusion can be avoided by noting whether the
argument of Φ(·) is a sequence or a pattern.
For example, the proﬁle of the pattern ψ = 1232421 is
ϕ = (2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0), since 3 and 4 appear once, 1 appears
twice, and 2 appears three times. Note that many patterns may
have the same proﬁle.
Remark: Observe that every proﬁle of patterns of length
n corresponds to a partition of the integer n. The number of

by revealing elements of x one by one, and using Azuma’s

Furthermore, assuming all symbol probabilities are smaller
than 1/2, it can be shown that E[n] ≥ N/2. Then, the claimed

The second property, stated in the following lemma, concerns patterns with same probability. The lemma that follows
provides the means for analyzing alternating sequences using
the techniques developed for i.i.d sequences, which allows
for signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations when compared to the general
Markov process analysis.

Markov processes. Prior results by Dhulipala and Orlitsky [6]
showed that in general, the per-symbol pattern redundancy
of a ﬁrst-order Markov process may be unbounded. For the
particular case of alternating sequences, however, we show
that the per-symbol pattern redundancy tends to zero.
Suppose that P is a collection of distributions over patterns
of length n and let Ψ(P) denote the set of patterns with
positive probability with respect to some distribution in P.
Denote the set of proﬁles of patterns in Ψ(P) by Φ (P). Also,
for a pattern ψ n of length n, let the set of all alternating
patterns with the same proﬁle as the proﬁle of ψ n be denoted
˜
by Ψ−1 (Φ (ψ n )).
If Ψ(P) is partitioned into M classes such that any distribution in P assigns the same probability to all patterns in the
same class, then the worst case redundancy is bounded by [7]

Lemma 2. Let ψ = ψ1 ψ2 · · · ψn and ψ = ψ1 ψ2 · · · ψn be two
alternating patterns with proﬁle ϕ such that the multiplicity of
ψn is equal to the multiplicity of ψn . For any i.i.d. distribution
p, we have p(ψ) = p(ψ ).
Proof: Let the alphabet be A = {a1 , a2 , · · · } and let the
probability of ai be pi . Assume ψn = a and ψn = b, with
a, b ∈ [k], where k is the number of elements appearing in
ψ. Let the multiplicity of i ∈ [k] in ψ be denoted by µi and
the multiplicity of i in ψ be denoted by µi . Note that, by
assumption, µa = µb .
Furthermore, let f be a bijection between the set
{1, 2, · · · , k} and a subset A ⊆ A of size k. This bijection
determines which symbol of the alphabet goes to which
symbol in the pattern. Then the probability assigned to pattern
ψ is

Namely, given a pattern ψ n−1 of length n−1, what is our best

observed symbol, for ψn ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 1 + maxi≤n−1 ψi }.

D ISTRIBUTION

In this section, we explain how to reconstruct the noiseless
source probabilities from estimates of probabilities provided
by alternating sequences. First, recall from Lemma 1, that with
high probability, n is of the same order as N and thus, with
high probability, the length n of the alternating sequence is
large if the length of the source sequence is large.
Assume that the source has alphabet A = {a1 , a2 , · · · } with
probability paj for element aj . Suppose pai aj is the probability
of observing aj after ai in the alternating sequence and assume
that the correct values of pa1 a2 and pa2 a1 are given. We have
p a2
p a1
p a1 a2 =

p a2 a1 =
1 − p a1
