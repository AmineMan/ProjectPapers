Abstract—We study the problem of sampling a highdimensional bandlimited ﬁeld on a union of shifted lattices
under certain assumptions motivated by some practical sampling
applications. Under these assumptions, we show that simple
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for perfect reconstruction can
be identiﬁed. We also obtain an explicit scheme for reconstructing
the ﬁeld from its samples on the various shifted lattices. We
illustrate our results using examples.

B. Paper organization
We begin by providing background on related problems in
Section II. In Section III we discuss the problem of sampling
on unions of shifted lattices and present our results and
examples. We conclude in Section IV.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Consider the problem of sampling and reconstructing a ddimensional ﬁeld f (r) : r ∈ Rd , where r represents a ddimensional spatial location. If f is bandlimited, the classical
sampling theorem of Petersen and Middleton [1] provide
schemes for sampling and reconstructing the ﬁeld from its
values measured on a lattice in Rd . Various results on more
general sampling conﬁgurations are also known (see, e.g.,
[2] [3] for a summary). One example of such a sampling
conﬁguration is a union of shifted lattices. Sampling on such
sets arises naturally in a number of applications in signal
processing and remote sensing [4], in interlaced sampling
schemes in tomography [5], in recovery of functions from
their local averages [6], and also in spatial sampling using
mobile sensors [7] . Such a conﬁguration is easy to analyze [8]
when the points lie on a union of shifted versions of the same
lattice. Recently more general results on sampling on a union
of shifted lattices have been obtained in an abstract harmonic
analysis framework [9] but, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no works that study the general problem in the classical
signal processing context.
In this paper, we study the problem of sampling on a
union of shifted lattices, under certain assumptions on the lattices. We describe practical spatial sampling scenarios where
these assumptions are satisﬁed. Under these assumptions,
we identify simple necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for
perfect reconstruction of bandlimited ﬁelds. We also provide
an explicit reconstruction scheme for perfectly recovering the
bandlimited ﬁeld from the measurements taken at the sampling
points. Our solution is easier to understand and implement than
the more general result on sampling on a union of lattices in
the abstract harmonic analysis literature.

II. BACKGROUND

AND RELATED RESULTS

We denote a ﬁeld in d-dimensional space by a complexvalued mapping f : Rd → C. For a ﬁeld f (.), we deﬁne its
Fourier transform F (.) as
F (ω) =

f (r) exp(−i ω, r )dr,

ω ∈ Rd

Rd

where i denotes the imaginary unit, and u, v denotes the
scalar product between vectors u and v in Rd . We use BΩ to
denote the collection of ﬁelds with ﬁnite energy such that the
Fourier transform F of f is supported on a set Ω ⊂ Rd , i.e.,
BΩ := {f ∈ L2 (Rd ) : F (ω) = 0 for ω ∈ Ω}.
/

(1)

A bandlimited ﬁeld has the advantage that it is possible to
represent the ﬁeld using only the samples of the ﬁeld measured
at a discrete collection of points. We say that a collection of
points Λ forms a sampling set for Ω if any ﬁeld f ∈ BΩ can be
uniquely reconstructed using only its values on the points in
Λ. We use SΩ to denote the collection of all sampling sets for
Ω. We now discuss known results on conditions for sampling
and reconstruction of bandlimited ﬁelds.
A. Sampling on a lattice
The most well-known result on sampling of bandlimited
ﬁelds deals with sampling on a lattice. A lattice Λ in Rd is
deﬁned as a collection of points of the form
d

mi vi : m ∈ Zd }

Λ={
i=1

A. Notation

where {vi : 1 ≤ i ≤ d} forms a basis for Rd . We say that the
lattice Λ is generated by the vectors {vi : 1 ≤ i ≤ d}. The
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on Λ for reconstructing

For vectors x, y ∈ Rd we use x, y to denote the innerproduct in Euclidean space. For any set Ω ⊂ Rd and r ∈ Rd

a ﬁeld f in BΩ using the samples of the ﬁeld taken on
Λ follow from the results of [1]. Let {ui : 1 ≤ i ≤ d}
denote a reciprocal set of lattice vectors in Rd satisfying
ui , vj = 2πδij . Then the associated sampled ﬁeld spectrum
is composed of spectral repetitions of f and is supported on

We now study the problem of sampling bandlimited ﬁelds f ∈
BΩ on the union of shifted versions of these lattices given by
N

Ω

mi ui . If the spectral repetitions overlap

where wk ∈ Rd represent the shifts. This problem has been
studied by various authors in one dimension [11] and higher
dimensions [9], [12]. However, in higher dimensions, the
conditions and algorithms for perfect reconstruction in [9] are
stated for locally compact abelian groups under an abstract
harmonic analysis framework. In this section, we show that
under certain conditions on the shifted lattices, this problem
admits a simple and explicit solution.
As we saw in Section II-A, the spectrum of the sampled
ﬁeld obtained by samples taken on each individual lattice Λk
is composed of spectral repetitions in d directions. We also
saw that if the repetitions in the sampled spectrum on a lattice
do not overlap, then the original ﬁeld can be reconstructed
exactly from the samples on this lattice. The same reasoning
holds for sampling on a shifted lattice since a spatial shift of
the ﬁeld f ∈ BΩ does not change the support of its Fourier
transform. However, while sampling a ﬁeld f ∈ BΩ on a union
of shifted lattices U , it may be possible to perfectly reconstruct
the ﬁeld f based on all the samples even if the samples on each
individual shifted lattice are aliased (e.g., see Example 3.2 later
in the paper). In this section we present some conditions and
schemes for perfect recovery. Let Q ⊂ Rd be deﬁned as

i=1

in the Fourier domain we say that the samples are aliased and
in this case it is not possible to perfectly reconstruct the ﬁeld
from its samples. The repetitions do not overlap provided
d

mi ui ) = ∅ for all m ∈ Zd \ {0}d.

i=1

This is the condition required to ensure that any ﬁeld f ∈ BΩ
can be reconstructed based on samples on the lattice Λ. For
example if a ﬁeld in R2 is bandlimited to a set Ω in the form
of a circular disc of radius ρ, then it can be reconstructed
exactly by sampling on a rectangular lattice with v1 = (X, 0)
and v2 = (0, Y ), provided X < π and Y < π .

B. Sampling on a union of shifts of a lattice
A shift of a lattice Λ is a set of the form Λ + w :
{x + w : x ∈ Λ} where w is a vector representing the
shift. A union of such shifted versions of the same lattice
Λ gives a more general conﬁguration of sampling points,
N
e.g., k=1 (Λ + wk ) where wk ∈ Rd are the shifts. Such a
conﬁguration of sampling points is also known by other names
such as periodic sampling or bunched sampling. Various authors have studied such sampling conﬁgurations and identiﬁed
schemes for perfect reconstruction from samples taken on such
a conﬁguration of points (see, e.g., [5] and references therein).
One approach for studying such sampling problems is to view
this as a special case of Papoulis’ generalized sampling [10]
in higher dimensions. Since a shift in the spatial domain can
be interpreted as a ﬁltering operation, the samples obtained
from each individual lattice in the union can be viewed as
samples of a ﬁltered version of the ﬁeld taken at points on
the original lattice Λ. Thus this problem can be interpreted as
a multichannel sampling problem and solved using Papoulis’
approach [10] as outlined in [8].
A more general sampling conﬁguration is a union of shifted
versions of lattices that are not necessarily identical. In the
following section, we consider this setting in detail. We
describe known results and then present new results.

The following proposition gives a simple necessary condition
on U and Ω for perfect reconstruction.
Proposition 3.1: Let Ω ⊂ Rd be a compact set and let U
denote a union of shifted lattices of the form (2). Suppose

It is easily veriﬁed that the ﬁeld fǫ vanishes at all points on
U . Hence fǫ cannot be distinguished from the function that is
identically zero using the ﬁeld samples on U . Moreover, for ǫ
small enough, the ﬁeld fǫ has a Fourier transform supported
within a subset of Ω. Thus U ∈ SΩ .
/
Under certain assumptions the simple necessary conditions
stated above are also sufﬁcient to ensure that U ∈ SΩ . We
require the following assumptions on U and Ω:

Sketch of proof: The result of (4) follows from Proposition 3.1. The sufﬁcient condition of (3) is proved by demonstrating an explicit reconstruction strategy. This follows by the
same steps as used to prove [7, Thm 4.3]. The proof is long
and hence omitted. We refer the reader to [7] for details.
Now that we have identiﬁed the conditions for perfect reconstruction, we now seek explicit reconstruction schemes
for reconstructing the bandlimited ﬁelds assuming that the
sufﬁcient condition of (3) holds. The reconstruction scheme
can be obtained by studying the spectra of the sampled ﬁelds.
In the sequel we use the following abusive notation for n ∈ Zd .

The assumption (A2) is equivalent to saying that each lattice
k
Λk is ﬁnely sampled along the directions {vj : j ≥ 2} so
that the overlaps in the corresponding sampled spectrum, if
any, arise due to repetitions in the direction uk . Hence under
1
assumption (A2) the spectrum from each shifted lattice Λk +
wk is aliased at most in one direction - the direction of uk .
1
Assumption (A1) is often satisﬁed in practical applications
of sampling low-pass phenomena. We now discuss practical
sampling scenarios where the assumption (A2) is satisﬁed.
Suppose that the process of sampling the ﬁeld is accomplished
by measuring the ﬁeld values along hyperplanes at ﬁne resolutions. For a ﬁeld in R2 , this means that the measurement
procedure involves scanning the ﬁeld along straight lines at
high resolutions. Such a scenario is well motivated in spatial
sampling using mobile sensors [7]. A mobile sensor moving
along a straight line can sample the ﬁeld at high resolutions
along its path without incurring any additional cost in terms
of distance traveled. Now consider a measurement setup in
which the measurements are taken by sensors moving along
a sequence of equispaced parallel lines. We refer to such a
sequence of equispaced parallel lines as a uniform set of
lines, like in [7]. If the samples taken on the various lines
are themselves aligned then the collection of all such samples
lies on a shifted lattice in R2 . If we have a collection of
several such uniform sets, then the collection of all samples
lie on a union of shifted lattices in R2 . Furthermore, since
the measurements are taken at a ﬁne resolution along the
lines assumption (A2) is satisﬁed. An example of such a
sampling conﬁguration is shown in Figure 1(a). Similarly, one
could consider a scheme for measuring ﬁelds in R3 on several
uniform sets of planes. If the samples from the planes on a
uniform set are aligned, then they form a shifted lattice in
R3 . The collection of all samples from several such uniform
sets lie on a union of shifted lattices in R3 and since the
measurements are taken at a ﬁne resolution along the planes,
it follows that assumption (A2) is satisﬁed.
Motivated by the practical examples provided above, we
show that, under assumptions (A1) and (A2), the necessary
conditions from Proposition 3.1 are also sufﬁcient for perfectly
reconstructing bandlimited ﬁelds in BΩ from their measurements on U . We have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.2: Let U be a union of shifted lattices in Rd
deﬁned in (2), and Ω ⊂ Rd satisfy1 Assumptions (A1)
and (A2). Suppose that the vectors {u1 , u2 , . . . , uN } are

In the following proposition we provide the structure of
the reconstruction scheme. To maintain continuity the proof is
relegated to the appendix.
Proposition 3.3: Let f ∈ BΩ denote a bandlimited ﬁeld.
Under the conditions of Theorem 3.2, there exists a partition
of Ω into mutually disjoint sets Ωℓ , ℓ = 1, 2, . . . , L, integers
1 ≤ mℓ < ∞, and scalars βi,k,n for i ∈ {1, . . . , L}, j ∈
{1, . . . , mi }, k ∈ {1, . . . , N }, n ∈ Zd such that

ˆ
characteristic function of Ωi .
⊓
⊔
Thus the interpolation formula of (7) can be used to reconstruct
the bandlimited ﬁeld f ∈ BΩ using only its samples. The
exact values of βi,k,n and Ωi depends on the speciﬁc problem
at hand. Thus (7) represents the interpolation formula for
reconstructing the ﬁeld f from its measurements on a union of
shifted lattices U under assumptions (A1) and (A2). We now
discuss some examples where we can explicitly evaluate the
values of βi,k,n and Ωi .

1 A different set of conditions for perfect reconstruction can be obtained
without Assumption (A1) provided a stronger version of (A2) holds.

Suppose ǫ < π which ensures that Assumption (A2) holds.
ρ
From Theorem 3.2, it follows that perfect reconstruction is
possible (i.e. U ∈ SΩ ) whenever ∆ < ∆∗ := 2π . Under this
ρ
condition, the partitions of Ω are as shown in Figure 2. We
see that unlike in the previous example now there are some
portions of Ω that are aliased in both the sampled spectra.
Now the sampled spectra satisfy the following relations:

Example 3.1 (Rectangular lattices and isotropic ﬁeld):
Suppose Ω is a circular disc of radius ρ centered at the origin,
corresponding to an isotropic bandlimited ﬁelds. And suppose
U is a union of shifted lattices as in (2) where Λ1 and Λ2
are both rectangular lattices with basis vectors

v1 = (0, ∆), v2 = (ǫ, 0), v1 = (∆, 0), v2 = (0, ǫ).

Assume that the lattices are not shifted so that w1 = w2 = 0.
The sampling conﬁguration U is illustrated in Figure 1(a)
where Λ1 is shown in black and Λ2 in red. If ǫ < π then
ρ
Assumption (A2) holds. Suppose that this condition holds.
From Theorem 3.2, it follows that perfect reconstruction is
√
2π
possible (i.e. U ∈ SΩ ) whenever ∆ < ∆∗ := ρ . Under
this condition the sampled spectra from the two lattices are
as depicted in Figure 1(b). We have shown only the supports
of the spectral repetitions that intersect with the main lobe.
Based on the sampled spectra, we can partition Ω into ﬁve
distinct regions as shown in Figure 1(c). Here Ω1 represents
the portion of Ω that is not aliased in either sampled spectrum,
Ω2 and Ω3 represent the portions that are aliased only in the
sampled spectrum from the ﬁrst lattice and Ω4 and Ω5 are the
portions aliased only in the sampled spectrum from the second
lattice. Hence the sampled spectra satisfy

Fs (ω) = F (ω),

Fs (ω) =

F (ω) + F (ω + u2 ),

ω ∈ Ω1 ∪ Ω2 ∪ Ω3

Thus the original spectrum can be recovered as

We have studied the problem of sampling and reconstructing
bandlimited ﬁelds on a union of shifted lattices under assumptions (A1) and (A2). These assumptions are well justiﬁed in
some practical problems of interest such as the sampling of
spatial ﬁelds using mobile sensors. Under these assumptions
we provide simple conditions for perfect reconstruction that
are easier to verify than those provided in known results [9]
on the general problem of sampling on a union of shifted
lattices. We also provide explicit reconstruction schemes that
are easier to implement than the known iterative reconstruction
schemes for the general problem.

A PPENDIX

In the above example every part of Ω was unaliased in at
least one of the sampled spectra and thus reconstruction was
straightforward. However, in some cases it is possible to
reconstruct the ﬁeld exactly even when this condition does
not hold, as we illustrate in the following example.
Example 3.2 (Rectangular lattices and non-isotropic ﬁeld):
Suppose Ω := {ω ∈ R2 : ωy ≥ 0, |ωx | + |ωy | ≤ ρ} is a
triangular region. As before let U be a union of two
rectangular lattices Λ1 and Λ2 with basis vectors given by

for any ω ∈ Ω, the sampled spectra Fs (ζ) : ζ ∈ W (ω), k ∈
