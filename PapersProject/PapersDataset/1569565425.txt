Beyond Worst-Case Reconstruction
in Deterministic Compressed Sensing

essary to reconstruct every sparse vector [7]. The goal of
average-case CS is to recover most (in contrast to all) k-sparse
vectors. Here, the sparse vector is often modeled to have a
uniformly random support and random sign for the k nonzero entries. The average-case CS framework relies on the
coherence and the spectral norm of the deterministic sensing
matrix. The ideal case is when coherence follows the Welch
bound [8], and different measurements are orthogonal. Then,
as long as k = O (M/log N ), with high probability a ksparse vector has a unique sparse representation, and can be
efﬁciently recovered from the compressive measurements [6].
In this paper, we construct an explicit basis for the null
space of a large family of deterministic sensing matrices
designed for the average-case CS framework (see [5] and the
references therein) using the indicator vectors of binary selfdual codes. Characterizing the null space of these matrices
makes it possible to investigate and analyze the geometric
properties of these matrices more precisely.
More speciﬁcally, we introduce a family of deterministic
sensing matrices called the extended Delsarte-Goethals frames
(EDGFs) that hold the following three properties simultane√
ously: (i) as long as k ≤ c1 M it is possible to recover
every k-sparse vector α from the measurement vector Φα; (ii)
√
there exists a k-sparse vector α with k = c2 M such that no
reconstruction algorithm can uniquely recover α from Φα; and
(iii) it is possible to recover most k-sparse vectors α from
M
the measurement vector Φα as long as k ≤ c3 log N (which
√
can be much larger than c2 M ), where c1 , c2 , and c3 are
ﬁxed constants. The EDGFs meet the coherence-based lower
bound on worst-case reconstruction and the order-optimal
upper bound on average-case reconstruction.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
reviews Delsarte-Goethals frames (DGFs). Section III explains
the properties of the self-dual codes used in this paper.
Sections IV and V characterize the null space of the DGFs
and the EDGFs. The experiments are provided in Section VI.
Section VII concludes the paper.

Abstract—The role of random measurement in compressive
sensing is analogous to the role of random codes in coding
theory. In coding theory, decoders that can correct beyond the
minimum distance of a code allow random codes to achieve
the Shannon limit. In compressed sensing, the counterpart of
minimum distance is the spark of the measurement matrix, i.e.,
the size of the smallest set of linearly dependent columns. This
paper constructs a family of measurement matrices where the
columns are formed by exponentiating codewords from a classical
binary error-correcting code of block length M . The columns can
be partitioned into mutually unbiased bases, and the spark of the
√
corresponding measurement matrix is shown to be O( M ) by
identifying a conﬁguration of columns that plays a role similar to
that of the Dirac comb in classical Fourier analysis. Further, an
explicit basis for the null space of these measurement matrices
is given in terms of indicator functions of binary self-dual codes.
Reliable reconstruction of k-sparse inputs is shown for k of order
M/ log(M ) which is best possible and far beyond the worst case
lower bound provided by the spark.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The central goal of compressed sensing (CS) is to capture
a signal using very few measurements. In most work to date,
this broader objective is exempliﬁed by the important special
case in which the measurement data constitute a vector f =
Φα+e where Φ is an M ×N matrix called the sensing matrix,
α ∈ RN is a k-sparse signal, and e ∈ RM is the additive
noise. There are two distinct CS frameworks with different
objectives.
Worst-case CS [1], [2]: In the worst-case CS framework,
the goal is to recover every k-sparse vector α from the
corresponding measurement vector f . It is known that certain
probabilistic processes generate sensing matrices that support
worst-case CS [3]. However, the random sensing framework
suffers from storage and computation limitations. As a result,
there has been a signiﬁcant amount of research on designing
alternative deterministic matrices for worst-case CS framework
over the last few years [4]. Most such constructions rely
on the coherence between the columns of the matrix. When
the coherence follows the Welch Bound µ = O √1 , the

Gerschgorin Circle Theorem√
guarantees reconstruction of any
k-sparse signal with k = O( M ).

including wireless communications and radar, it is not nec-

II. BACKGROUND AND N OTATION
A. Worst-case vs. Average-case Compressed Sensing
A vector is k-sparse if it has at most k non-zero entries.
The support of a k-sparse vector indicates the positions of its
non-zero entries. Let Φ be an M ×N matrix. Then Φ is a tightframe with redundancy ρ if ΦΦ† = ρIN ×N , where Φ† denotes
the conjugate transpose of Φ. The spark of the measurement
matrix Φ, denoted as spark(Φ), is the size of the smallest set

As a result, it follows from Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 that as
√
long as k = O( M /2r ), it is possible to recover every ksparse vector α from Φα using the 1 -minimization method.;
moreover, even if k = O 22r M N it is still possible to

recover most k-sparse vectors α from Φα using the same
techniques.

In this paper, we simplify the analysis by focusing on the
noiseless CS problem, and note that it is straightforward to
generalize the analysis to include noise. The following two
theorems relate the maximum sparsity level k to the parameters
of the sensing matrix Φ, so that it is possible to efﬁciently
recover all (respectively most) k-sparse vectors α from Φα.
Theorem 2.1 (Worst-case CS [9]): Let Φ be a an M × N
sensing matrix with worst-case coherence µΦ . Then as long as
k = O(µ−1 ), it is possible to efﬁciently recover every k-sparse
Φ
vector α from the measurement vector Φα. In contrast, when
k ≥ spark(Φ) , there exist multiple k-sparse vectors that are
2
mapped to the same measurement vector, rendering recovery
impossible.
Theorem 2.2 (Average-case CS [6], [10]): Let Φ be a an
M × N tight-frame with redundancy ρ = N/M and with
µ−2
M
Φ
worst-case coherence µΦ . If k = O min log N , log N ,
then with probability 1 − 1/N , it is possible to efﬁciently
recover a k-sparse vector α with uniformly random support
and uniformly random sign from the measurement vector Φα.

We start by deﬁning a binary self-dual code and explaining
some of its properties.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Binary Self-Dual Code): A binary code C is
self-dual if
.
C ⊥ = u : u w = 0 ∀ w ∈ C = C,
(2)
Let C be a self-dual code of length m, and let b be a binary
m-tuple vector in the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fm . Throughout the paper,
2
by b ⊕ C we mean {b ⊕ c : c ∈ C}.
Deﬁnition 3.2: Let C be a binary self-dual code of length
m. The binary vector v of length M = 2m with entries v(x) =
1 if x ∈ C and v(x) = 0 if x ∈ C is called the indicator of C.
/
A direct calculation, captured in the following lemma,
shows that the indicator of a self-dual code can be viewed as
the binary counterpart of the Dirac comb in Fourier analysis.
Lemma 3.1: Let C be a binary self-dual linear code of
length m, and let v ∈ {0, 1}M be the indicator of C. Let
H be the M × M Hadamard matrix. Then Hv = |C|v.
Next, we use the vector v to construct a sparse vector in
the null space of the matrix Φ0 = I, √1 H .
M

Throughout this paper, m denotes an integer and M = 2m .
Given a vector v with binary entries, we let v(x) denote the
entry of v indexed by x. The inner product of two binary
vectors u, v is denoted by u v.

I. Φ0 is a tight frame with redundancy 2.
√
II. v2 is a 2 M -sparse vector in the null space of Φ0 .
√
Therefore spark(Φ0 ) ≤ 2 M .
Proof: We prove each part separately:
I. Φ0 is a union of two orthonormal bases, therefore
ΦΦ† = 2IM ×M .
II. Every self-dual code of length m has dimension m , and
2
√
hence exactly M different codewords. Therefore,√ is

M -sparse, and by construction, v2 has exactly 2 M
non-zero entries. Moreover, it follows from Lemma 3.1

that Hv = M Iv or equivalently I, √1 H [−v, v] =

0.

The Delsarte-Goethals frames (DGFs) are a class of CS
matrices that have been recently introduced by Calderbank,
Howard, and Jafarpour [5]. Speciﬁcally, let m be an odd
positive integer, and r to be an integer smaller than m−1 .
2
Next, let DG(m, r) denote the Delsarte-Goethals set of binary symmetric matrices, as described in [11]. Then, given
M = 2m and N = M r+2 , the M × N DGF Φ is constructed
from DG(m, r) in the following way. Index the rows of Φ by
binary vectors x ∈ Fm and index the columns of Φ by pairs
2
(P, b), where P ranges over all 2(r+1)m binary symmetric
matrices DG(m, r) and b ranges over all members of Fm .

where the second equality follows from the fact that both Pz1
and z2 are codewords of C. If this linear map is the zero
map on x, then |η(x)|2 = |C||C0 |, and otherwise η(x) = 0.
As a result, η(x) vanishes for all but 2t values of x, where
t = m − dim(C0 ).

self
√ Proof: Since v is the indicator of a √ dual code, it
is M -sparse. Moreover, there are exactly M offsets a that
produce distinct shifts of v. The reason is that since C is linear,
if c is any codeword of C, then both Aa v and Aa⊕c v provide
the same vector whose non-zero entries correspond to indices
of the form z ⊕ a where z ranges over all codewords. That is
Aa v = Aa⊕c v. Similarly, since C is self-dual, for every pair
of codewords z and c√ have (−1)b z = (−1)(b⊕c) z . This
we
implies that there are M distinct choices b for the frequency
shift of the vector v.
Now we show that these M vectors are orthogonal. To see
this, let (a, b) and (a , b ) be two distinct pairs of time and
frequency shift offsets. Let ξ1 = Ba Ab v and ξ2 = Ba Ab v.
Then, it is sufﬁcient to show that if ξ1 and ξ2 are distinct,
then ξ1 ξ2 = 0.
Since v is the indicator vector of a linear self-dual code,
then if Supp(ξ1 ) ∩ Supp(ξ2 ) contains some element y, then

This set has M elements, and since both supports also have

result, if Ab v = Ab v then Supp(ξ1 ) ∩ Supp(ξ2 ) = Ø, and

In this section, we use the results of the previous sections
and design an M × N sensing matrix with M
N for
which there exists constants c1 , c2 , and c3 , such that (i) it
is possible to uniquely recover every k-sparse vectors as long
√
as k ≤ c1 M ; (ii) there exists a k-sparse vector α with
√
k = c2 M such that no reconstruction algorithm is able to
uniquely recover it from the measurement vector f = Φα; and
(iii) it is possible to uniquely recover most k-sparse vectors
as long as k ≤ c3 M/ log N .
The extended Delsarte-Goethals frame (EDGF) is constructed by concatenating the M × M identity matrix to a
DGF.
Theorem 5.1: Let r be a constant integer, and let m > 2r +

I. The EDGF has M = 2m rows, and N = M r+2 + M

II. The EDGF is a tight frame with redundancy M r+1 + 1,

and coherence √M .
Proof: The proof of Part I follows from the construction
of the EDGF. To prove Part II. observe that the EDGF is a
union of orthonormal bases, and therefore it is a tight-frame
N
with redundancy M . The coherence bound follows from the
fact that the inner product between two distinct columns of a

DGF is bounded by √M , and that the inner product between
a column of a DGF, and a column of the identity matrix is
bounded by √1 .

C be a self-dual code such that for any codeword c, Pc is
also a codeword in C. Let v denote the indicator vector of the
codewords of C. Let
W2 =

(−1)(y⊕a)

Since C is self-dual and y and P y are both codewords in C, the
mapping y → 2(b + x + aP ) y + y P y is a linear map from
C to Z4 . √
Theorem 3.2 now guarantees that w(x) is non-zero
only for M choices of x.
Remark 4.1: So far we have shown how to generate a basis
for the null space of a M × 2M matrix of the form [DH, H].
This construction can be generalized to matrices of form
[DR H, · · · , D1 H, H] in a straightforward manner by ﬁrst zeropadding each null space vector, so that it becomes (R + 1)M dimensional, and then collecting all these RM vectors. For
instance, a basis for the null space of a M × 3M matrix
[D2 H, D1 H, H] has the form

x (a⊕a )
Therefore, we must have
= 0,
x:x⊕b∈C (−1)
which proves that ξ1 and ξ2 are orthogonal. A similar argument
can be used to show that if ξ1 = Aa Bb v and ξ2 = Aa Bb v,
then, if ξ1 and ξ2 are distinct, then ξ1 ξ2 = 0.
As a result, we have M distinct linearly independent vectors
of the form w2 = [Aa Bb v; −Ba Ab v] which are all in the null
space of Φ0 . On the other hand, since Φ0 is M × 2M , its
null space has dimension M , and therefore the M null space
vectors above form a basis for the null space of Φ0 .
Next we show that the same argument can be used to form
an orthogonal basis for the null space of matrices of form

EDGF is at most 2 M . As a result, there can be two distinct

M -sparse vectors mapped to the same low-dimemsional
measurement vector. On the other hand, Theorem 2.1 states
that it is possible to √
uniquely recover every k-sparse vector
with sparsity k ≤ c1 M . In contrast, it follows from Theorem 2.2 that if α is a k-sparse vector with uniformly random
support and random sign, then as long as k ≤ c3 M/ log N
√
(which can be much larger than c1 M ), α is uniquely
recoverable from f = Φα with overwhelming probability.

We have determined a natural basis for the null space

null space contains a vector that is 2 M -sparse. We have
demonstrated that this family of measurement matrices meets
√
the lower bound of k = O( M ) on worst-case CS as well as
the order optimal upper bound of k = O(M/ log(N )).

VI. E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS
The experiments of this section compare the performance
of the Basis Pursuit algorithm [6] in recovering sparse vectors
with uniformly random supports versus recovering sparse
vectors supported on a rank-deﬁcient submatrix obtained using
a self-dual code. We provide the comparisons for the DGFs
(Fig. 1), as well as for the EDGFs (Fig. 2).
In Fig. 1 we used a 256 × 512 matrix of the form Φ =
√1 [H, D1 H], where D1 is a diagonal matrix with dD (x) =
1
M
ix Px , and P is the 8 × 8 zero-diagonal binary symmetric
matrix obtained from applying the Gray map [12] to a 7 × 7
binary DG(7, 0) matrix. We also used the self-dual Hamming
code C of length 8 in order to ﬁnd a rank-deﬁcient submatrix
of Φ.
A simple calculation reveals that only 4 codewords are in C0
(deﬁned by eq. (3)). Therefore, dim(C0 ) = 2, and Theorem 3.2
predicts that HD−1 v must have 256/4 = 64 non-zero entries.

A direct calculation reveals that HD−1 v indeed has 64 non1
zero entries. Therefore, the null space of √1 [H, D1 H] has a
M
80-sparse element. That is, there exists, a 256 × 80 submatrix
of Φ that is rank-deﬁcient. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Basis
Pursuit Algorithm fails to recover some k-sparse vectors with
sparsity level k > 40 which are supported on this rankdeﬁcient submatrix. However, it is still possible to recover
most k-sparse vectors with uniformly random support over
the 512 columns, even for sparsity level k = 80. Fig. 2 shows
the result of the same experiment using an EDGF.
