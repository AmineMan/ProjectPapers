Our achievability scheme has two phases, a key-generation
and a key-consumption phase. We ﬁrst create, using the erasure
channel properties, a common key between Alice and each
user, that is secure from the remaining users (even if they
collude). Key generation comes at cost since it occupies the
wireless channel without actually conveying information; we
thus need to calculate how much key we need, and efﬁciently create it (we construct the key using similar techniques
proposed in our earlier work [3], [4]). How much key we
need depends on how we use it. A straightforward approach
would be to use each secret key as a one-time pad; this is
too pessimistic. Indeed, assume Alice transmits information
to Bob: Calvin and David (jointly) are going to receive only
a fraction of the packets intended for Bob and thus we only
need to create an amount of key that allows protection of this
fraction. This is exactly what the scheme we propose does.
Our main contributions are:
• we design a simple two phase protocol, that generates
and consumes keys;
• we derive an outer bound that explicitly mirrors the
balance between key generation and key consumption,
and show that our achievability scheme matches it for
all the cases where the communication problem is solved
without security requirements;
• as a side result, we provide an alternative proof for the
outer bound of the non-secure communication problem.

Abstract—Consider a source, Alice, broadcasting private messages to multiple receivers through a broadcast erasure channel;
users send back to Alice public feedback that she causally uses
to decide the coding strategy for her following transmissions.
Recently, the multiple unicast capacity region for this problem
has been exactly characterized for a number of special cases;
namely the 2-user, 3-user, symmetric K-user, and one-sidedly
fair K-user [1], [2].
In this paper, we show that for all the cases where such
characterizations exist, we can also optimally characterize the
“secure” communication rates, where the message that Alice
transmits to each user is information theoretically secure from
the other users, even if these collude. We show that a simple,
two-phase strategy, where appropriate amounts of secret keys
are ﬁrst generated and then consumed, matches a new outer
bound we derive.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Wireless communication channels are easier to eavesdrop
and harder to secure – even towards unintentional eavesdroppers. As an example consider a sender, Alice, who wants
to send private messages to multiple (say three) receivers,
Bob, Calvin and David, within her transmission radius, and
assume public feedback from the receivers to Alice. When
Alice broadcasts a message W1 intended for Bob, Calvin and
David should also try to overhear, as the side information
they possibly collect can enable Alice to make her following
broadcast transmissions more efﬁcient; but then, this collected
side information would allow Calvin and David to learn parts
of Bob’s message. Even worse, Calvin and David could try
to put together the parts they overheard, to extract increased
information about Bob’s message. Can we, in such a setting,
keep the message for each user information theoretically secure from the other users, even if these collaborate? Moreover,
can we do so, when the users can only communicate through
shared wireless broadcast channels?
In this paper we answer these questions when communication happens through broadcast erasure channels. We exactly
characterize the capacity region in all the cases where the
problem has been solved with no security constraints, namely,
the 2-user, 3-user, symmetric K-user, and one-sidedly fair Kuser [2]. For each such case, we present a new outer bound
and a simple achievability scheme that matches it.

A. Related Work
Secure transmission of messages using noisy channel properties was pioneered by Wyner [5], who characterized the
secret message capacity of wiretap channels. This led to a
long sequence of research on information-theoretic security
on various generalizations of the wiretap channel [6], [7].
Notably, when the eavesdropper and legitimate channel are
statistically identical, then the wiretap framework yields no
security. The fact that feedback can give security even in this
case was ﬁrst observed for secret key agreement by Maurer [8]
and further developed by Ahlswede-Csiszár [9] – but secure
key agreement is not the same as secure transmission of
speciﬁc messages. The wiretap channel with secure feedback
and its variants for message security have been studied in [10],
[11], [12]; some conclusive results are developed in special
cases when there is a secure feedback inaccessible to the
eavesdropper. Security of private message broadcasting without feedback has been studied in [13], where some conclusive
results have been established. As mentioned earlier, the use

RESULTS

Our main result is the characterization of the secrecy
capacity region for sending private messages to K receivers
over a broadcast erasure channel, for all the cases where the
capacity without secrecy constraints has been characterized,
namely, the 2-user, 3-user, symmetric K-user and one-sidedly
fair K-user (for exact deﬁnitions see [2]).
A. The three receivers (K=3) case
Our ﬁrst result, provided in Section V-A, is a new alternative
converse proof for the following known theorem [2], [1],
which characterizes the capacity region in the case of nonsecure communication.

where ⊥ is the symbol of an erasure.
Further, we assume that the (erasure) state Si of the channel
during the ith transmission (i.e., which receivers experienced
erasures) is strictly causally available to all parties; we use
when needed the notation Si = CD to denote that Calvin and
David have correctly received Xi , while Bob experienced an
erasure, and similarly for the other cases.
b) Reliability and security: The messages W1 , W2 and
W3 are deﬁned as vectors of length N1 , N2 and N3 over packets. We assume that messages are independent and uniformly
distributed over their respective message space. Beside the
messages, Alice may also generate some private randomness,
which we denote ΘA .

case of secure communication.

A sender, Alice, wants to send private messages to a set of
K receivers: she wants to send message Wi to receiver i, so
that, no other receiver learns Wi , even if all other receivers
collude. For simplicity, we describe our system for the case
of three receivers, which we will refer to as Bob, Calvin and
David, respectively, but the model extends to K receivers.
a) Communication model: Communication takes place
over a 1-to-3 broadcast erasure channel, with input at Alice
and an output each at Bob, Calvin, and David. The channel
input alphabet consists of all possible vectors of length L over
a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq . For convenience, we usually call each such
vector a packet. We denote by Xi the ith transmission over
the channel, and by Y1,i , Y2,i , Y3,i the corresponding outputs
observed by Bob, Calvin and David. We use X n to denote
the vector (X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn ) and we use a similar notation
for other vectors as well. The broadcast channel is made up
of three independent component erasure channels with erasure
probabilities δ1 , δ2 , δ3 :

The ﬁrst term in (8) captures the key generation phase while

provide in Section IV a scheme that achieves any rate tuple in
the region deﬁned by (8), and in Section V a matching outer

B. Additional cases
For all cases where we have a non-secure capacity achieving
scheme as in Theorem 1, we also have a matching secure
capacity characterization using similar techniques to those in
Theorem 2. This is the case for K = 2, if the channel parameter δi is the same for every receiver (symmetric channel) or
when the rate vector is one-sidedly fair [2]. In the remaining

Let KB denote the key between Alice and Bob, and
similarly for KC and KD .
Alice transmits n1 random packets X1 , . . . , Xn1 generated
uniformly at random over FL . KB is the vector of the ﬁrst

k1 packets Xi for which Si = B. If there are less than k1
such packets, we stop and declare an error. Similarly, key KC
(and KD ) are created using the ﬁrst k2 (k3 ) packets for which
Si = C (Si = D), or an error is declared whenever there are
too few such packets. In other words, Alice transmits random
packets, and we treat a packet received by only one receiver
as a shared secret between Alice and that receiver.

2) Encrypted broadcast

IV. S ECURE 1- TO -3 BROADCAST: ACHIEVABILITY

We now follow the two transmission steps in the non-secure
protocol IV-A, with the following modiﬁcations: in Step (a),
we encrypt the message packets using key packets as we
specify in the following; in Step (b), we simply reuse the
already encrypted packets from Step (a) to create the required
linear combinations – we do not use additional key packets.
Step (2.a): Before transmitting each message packet to
receiver i, Alice encrypts it by XOR-ing it with a key packet
that has either not been used for encryption in the past, or
if used, none of the other users received the corresponding
transmitted packet.
Consider the transmissions to Bob. Initially Alice encrypts
Bob’s ﬁrst packet as W1,1 ⊕ KB,1 and transmits it until it is
received by at least one of the receivers. If only Bob receives
this encrypted packet, she reuses the same key packet KB,1
to encrypt the next message packet. Subsequently, if for some

i and j < N1 , k < k1 : Xi = W1,j = W1,j ⊕ KB,k , then


if Si = B
 ′

W1,j+1 = W1,j+1 ⊕ KB,k+1 , otherwise.

We ﬁrst give a slightly modiﬁed version of the non-secure
capacity achieving scheme in [2], that we will use as a building
block.
A. Protocol for non-secure 1-to-3 broadcast [2]
Conceptually, this algorithm has two main steps:
Step (a) Alice repeats each message packet W1,1 , . . . , W1,N1 ,
W2,1 , . . . , W2,N2 and W3,1 , . . . , W3,N3 until at least one
of the three receivers correctly receives it.
Step (b) Alice sends linear combinations of the packets that are
not received by their intended receiver in Step (a).
A key contribution of [2] is in specifying how to construct the
linear combinations in Step (b) – we refer the reader to [2] for
the exact constructions, and highlight here the two important
properties we rely on:
• A message packet successfully delivered to its intended
receiver in Step (a) is never used in Step (b).
• The scheme achieves any rate point within the region
in (7).
B. Protocol for secure 1-to-3 broadcast
Our scheme consists of two phases.
1) Key generation. We create three different keys, each key
shared between Alice and one receiver, and perfectly
secure from the remaining two receivers even if they
collude.
2) Encrypted broadcast. Using the keys set up in the ﬁrst
phase, we employ an encrypted version of the nonsecure 1-to-3 broadcast scheme described.
To describe each phase in detail, we deﬁne a few parameters.
The length of the secret keys we aim to set up for the receivers

In other words, a key is reused until a packet encrypted using
it is received by either Calvin and David. We declare an error
if the k1 key packets are not sufﬁcient to encrypt all the
N1 message packets of W1 . Similarly for the other keys and
messages.
Step (2.b): At the end of Step (2.a), Bob, Calvin and David
have received as side information encrypted packets that are
not intended for them; we use the same encoding as in Step (b)
of the non-secure protocol IV-A to deliver these packets to
their intended receivers.

Condition (1) is clearly satisﬁed by our scheme. We show

In Step (2.a), every packet W1,j that Calvin and/or David
receive has been encrypted using a different key packet KB,i ;
these key packets, from (9), are secret from Calvin and David.
Thus the packets received by Calvin and David are onetime-pad encrypted and perfectly secret to them, even if they
collude. In Step (2.b), Alice transmits linear combinations of
′
packets W1,j that have not been received by Bob, but have
already been received either by Calvin and/or David – thus,
assuming these receivers collude, they do not receive any

innovative W1,j . This concludes our argument.
We next prove (2). Trivially, if no error is declared, Bob can
′
retrieve W1 from W1 using his key KB . We next show that
the probability of declaring an error can be made arbitrarily
small. It is enough to consider the following two error events
since the other error events are similar: (i) we do not obtain
k1 key packets for Bob in Phase 1, and (ii) k1 key packets are
not sufﬁcient in Step (2.a).
(i) Denote by κ the number of packets in Phase 1 that are
received only by Bob. Then, κ is the sum of n1 i.i.d. Bernoulli
variables drawn from Ber(p), where p = (1 − δ1 )δ2 δ3 . Thus,

for some constant c > 0. The last inequality follows from
the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound. Selecting N1 sufﬁciently large,
this error probability can be made arbitrarily small.
(ii) is similar, it occurs if the number of packets that only
Bob receives is signiﬁcantly less than its expected value, and
the same technique applies.
With this we have shown that the scheme satisﬁes (1)(6). A straightforward calculation with the given parameters
together with the capacity achieving property of the second
phase shows that our proposed schemes achieves any rate tuple
within the region given by (8), which concludes the proof of
achievability of Theorem 2.

In our security model we assume honest-but-curious adversaries. This means that the security of our scheme relies on the
honest feedback from every party. Related relevant problems
are when the adversary is a passive eavesdropper and does
not give any feedback, or when the feedback she gives can
be dishonest. Interestingly enough, in the case of one or two
parties the capacity region does not change compared to the
honest-but-curious adversary. These problems are addressed
in [4], [17], however their generalization for more than two
parties is not trivial.
