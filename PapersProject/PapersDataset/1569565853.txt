The main result appears as Theorem 1 in Section III. We
begin by formally introducing the problem set-up.

Abstract—We investigate the tradeoﬀs between rate (bits per
channel use) and throughput (bits per time) in network coding
over networks of independent noisy or noiseless channels under
on-oﬀ scheduling. While some networks exhibit an inherent tradeoﬀ between rate and throughput at ﬁnite blocklengths, our main
result shows that rate and throughput can be simultaneously
maximized in the limit of large blocklengths.

II. Preliminaries
A. Network Model
We deﬁne a network N using a pair (G, C), where G = (V, E)
is a directed graph with vertex set V and directed edge set
E ⊆ V × V, and C = (Ce : e ∈ E) is a corresponding collection
of channels. For each e = (u, v) ∈ E, channel

I. Introduction
Consider a communication scenario in which nodes transmit
data to their respective destinations over a network of directed
links. The capacities of such networks are studied under a
variety of models. In acyclic network models, nodes are often
operated sequentially (e.g., [1], [2]), so that all incoming
information is available to each node before it begins to
transmit. In other models (e.g., [3], [4]), all nodes are operated
simultaneously in every time step.
This paper investigates the communications implications of
operating codes under this range of scenarios. Speciﬁcally,
since n uses of each channel require n|V| time steps in the ﬁrst
scenario and n time steps in the second, we choose α ∈ [1, |V|]
and investigate the “α-capacity,” which is deﬁned in Section II
to be the set of asymptotically achievable rates using codes that
employ n uses of each channel over at most αn time steps.
Large values of α make more information available to each
node prior to transmission, thereby potentially increasing the
rate (bits per channel use) that can be reliably delivered. This
beneﬁt is gained, however, at the cost of longer run time,
thereby potentially decreasing the same code’s throughput (bits
per unit time). Since the rate, R, and throughput, T , of a
code employing n uses of each channel over αn time steps
are related as T = R/α, the α-capacity captures the tradeoﬀ
between rate and throughput. Understanding this tradeoﬀ is
useful for considering scenarios where both power and time
are constrained resources. Restricting power may prohibit the
transmission of every node in every time step. Restricting
time may prohibit operating very few nodes at each time.
Investigating α-capacity sheds light on this tradeoﬀ as the
number of uses of each channel grows without bound.

Ce = (X (e) , pe (y(e) |x(e) ), Y (e) )

has transmitter u with input alphabet X (e) , receiver v with
output alphabet Y (e) , and conditional distribution pe . For each
e ∈ E, we assume that both X (e) and Y (e) include the notransmission symbol and that distribution pe satisﬁes
pe (y(e) |x(e) ) =

focuses exclusively on ﬁxed-schedule codes.
We similarly denote the times at which node v ∈ V operates

A network solution, also called a network code, is a mechanism for establishing connections across a network N. For
each u ∈ V, let

Rα (N) = R1 (N).

C. Fixed-Schedule Codes

Proof: By the given deﬁnitions, R1 (N) ⊆ Rα (N) for each
α ∈ [1, |V|]. Thus, we need only show that Rα (N) ⊆ R1 (N).
Fix α ∈ [1, |V|], λ > 0, and R ∈ int(Rα (N)), where
int(Rα (N)) is the relative interior of set Rα (N). Since R ∈
int(Rα (N)), there exists a solution S(N) for N with rate
R(S(N) ≥ R, expansion α(S(N)) ≤ α, and error probability
Pe (S(N)) ≤ λ. Lemma 2 shows that given solution S(N)
˜
and any µ > 0, there exists a solution S(N) with rate
˜
˜
R(S(N)) ≥ (1 − 2H(λ))R, expansion α(S(N)) ≤ (1 + µ) and
error probability Pe (S(N)) ≤ λ. Let m be the blocklength of

The inclusion of the no-transmission symbol implies that
any network solution operates according to a transmission
schedule T = (T (e) : e ∈ E), where

which is the vector describing the number of message bits per
channel use for each message, and its expansion factor

n
which is the solution’s ratio of blocklength to channel uses.
Expansion factor α(S(N)) characterizes the ratio of rate to
throughput for a given solution. That is, any solution achieving
rate vector R and expansion factor α achieves throughput
vector T = R/α = (R(u→V) /α : (u, V) ∈ M).
Deﬁnition 1: Rate vector R = (R(u→V) : (u, V) ∈ M) is αachievable on network N if for any λ > 0 there exists a ﬁxedschedule solution S(N) with error probability Pe (S(N)) ≤ λ,
rate R(S(N)) ≥ R,1 and expansion ratio α(S(N)) ≤ α. The
α-capacity region R(N) for network N is the closure of the
set of α-achievable rates.

describes the times at which at the channels associated with
the edge (v, w) is active. If T (e) is independent of the
message choice and channel operations, then we call S(N)
a ﬁxed-schedule code. Fixed-schedule codes are not optimal
in general: Allowing the no transmission symbol to be used
like any other symbol eﬀectively increases the alphabet size
of the channel and therefore the network capacity. They are,

solution S(N); that is, solution S(N) is implemented over m
time steps and n ≥ m/(1 + µ) channel uses. Using solution
˜
˜
S(N), we build a solution S (N) implemented over m time
˜
steps and m channel uses. Solution S (N) sets each channel
˜
input precisely equal to the corresponding input in S(N)
in the active time steps and sends arbitrary symbols (other
than the no-transmission symbol) in the remaining time steps.
˜
Using this approach, R(S (N)) ≥ (1 − 2H(λ))R/(1 + µ),
˜ (N)) ≤ λ, and α(S (N)) = 1. Since λ and µ can be
˜
P e (S
made arbitrarily small, R ∈ R1 (N).
Theorem 1 demonstrates that asymptotically there is no
tradeoﬀ between rate and throughput. That is, since a rateR, expansion-α code has throughput T = R/α, and the space
of achievable rate vectors R is invariant in α, R and T can
always be simultaneously maximized by setting α to 1. It is
important to note, however, that the tradeoﬀ vanishes only as
the number of channel uses, n, grows without bound. For any
ﬁnite n and any error probability λ, increasing α may, in fact,
increase achievable rate while certainly decreasing throughput
– giving the anticipated tradeoﬀ between these two criteria.
What Theorem 1 demonstrates is that that tradeoﬀ becomes
negligible as n grows without bound.
Another interesting implication of Theorem 1 is that scalar
and vector coding are asymptotically equivalent. This result
does not contradict [5], [6], which together suggest a diﬀerence
between the two in the domain of linear coding. Instead, it
highlights a distinction between our system model and the
ones used in [5], [6], which consider only codes with a single
channel use over either a scalar or a vector alphabet.
Theorem 1 is related to [7, Theorem 2], which shows that
adding any ﬁnite collection of delays to a network has no
impact on the network’s capacity. Theorem 1 diﬀers from
this earlier result, however, in two critical ways. First, the
“delays” are here controlled by the code designer, and second,
the number of delays grows without bound as the number of
channel uses goes to inﬁnity.

by increasing the number of channel uses for the edge e by
picking n − |T (e)| time steps from the set {1, 2 . . . , m} \ T (e)
and transmitting arbitrary symbols at these time steps on the
edge e.

We next design a non-overlapping solution S(N) with en˜

each time-1 encoder, followed by each time-2 encoder, and so
on to obtain a code that employs n uses of each channel over
|V|n time steps. For each i ∈ {1, . . . , |V|} and each t ∈ T (vi ),
let F(t, vi ) denote the time at which encoder ft(vi ) operates

IV. Supporting Results
Before proceeding to Lemma 2, which is used in the proof
of Theorem 1, we ﬁrst introduce Lemma 1, which is used in
the proof of Lemma 2. Lemma 1 shows that every solution
S(N) can be modiﬁed to obtain a solution in which at most
one node transmits at any time instant. We call such solutions
non-overlapping solutions, as deﬁned formally below.
Deﬁnition 2: A solution S(N) is a non-overlapping solution
if for each v1 , v2 ∈ V such that v1 v2 , T (v1 ) ∩ T (v2 ) = φ.
Lemma 1: Given any solution S(N), there exists a non˜
˜
overlapping solution S(N) with expansion factor α(S(N)) =
|V| that achieves the same error probability and rate
˜
˜
(Pe (S(N)) = Pe (S(N)) and R(S(N)) = R(S(N))).
Proof: Consider an arbitrary solution S(N) for network N
with vertices {v1 , . . . , v|V| }. Let n, m, f , and g be the number
of channel uses, number of time steps, encoders, and decoders,
respectively, for solution S(N), as deﬁned in Section II.
Without loss of generality, we assume that |T (e)| = n for
all e ∈ E; if T (e) < n for some e, then we modify S(N)

Lemma 2 uses Lemma 1 and the notion of a stacked network
introduced in [4] to show that any solution with expansion
factor α can be used to construct an expansion-1 solution
with similar error probability and rate. Before proceeding to
Lemma 2, we brieﬂy review the deﬁnition of stacked networks.
As deﬁned in [4], given any network N, the N-fold
stacked network N comprises N copies of N, denoted
by N(1), N(2), . . . , N(N), with inﬁnite-capacity bidirectional
edges connecting all N copies of a given vertex v ∈ V to
each other. Thus, for each v ∈ V,
∈ {1, . . . , N}, and
t ∈ {1, . . . , m}, the symbol X (v) ( ) transmitted by node v in
t
layer at time t may be a function of messages W (v→∗) and
received vectors Y (v) , where

Network solution S(N) ﬁrst channel codes each message
˜ (u→V) ∈ W (u→V) to obtain a coded message W (u→V) ∈
W
W (u→V) and then independently operates solution S[ ] (N) in
each layer ∈ {1, . . . , N} of the stack, as shown in Figure 2.
The formal deﬁnition follows.

≤ 1 + µ.

Proof: By Lemma 1, there is no loss of generality in
assuming that solution S(N) is a non-overlapping solution
with expansion α(S(N)) = |V|. Let S(N) be implemented over
m = n|V| time steps and n channel uses. Let the encoder and
decoder mappings for S(N) be f and g. Let Pe (S(N)) = λ.
Given any N ∈ N+ and δ > 0, let N be the N|V|-fold stacked
network for N. The argument that follows ﬁrst constructs a
solution S(N) with message alphabet (W)N(1−δ)|V| ; solution
S(N) operates over m + N|V| − 1 time steps, achieving error
˜
probability Pe (S(N)). The next step builds a solution S(N)
that “unravels” S(N) across time – operating the solution for
the stacked network over N by appropriately sequencing its
transmissions. The ﬁnal step bounds the error probability, rate,
˜
and expansion ratio of solution S(N).

Since solution S(N) operates the N|V| layers of N independently and the use of a random channel code with codewords

equivalent to N|V| independent uses of a discrete memoryless
channel with crossover probability Pe (S(N)) and capacity no
less than 1−H(Pe (S(N))). Thus, the randomly chosen channel

where, the expectation is taken with respect to the random
channel code design. Given this bound on the expected error
probability of a randomly designed, there exists a solution
S(N) that does at least as well.
˜
Construction of S(N): Next, we operate the solution S(N)
˜
over the network N to obtain a solution S(N) with message
˜ (u→V) : (u, V) ∈ M). Solution S(N) is imple˜
alphabets (W
mented over mn + nN|V| − n time steps.
Let T be the schedule for solution S(N). For each v ∈
V, let T (e) = {τ(e, 1), . . . , τ(e, |T (e)|)} be the elements of
T (e), where τ(e, j) is increasing in j. Recall that S(N) is
implemented over n channel uses. Therefore, |T (e)| ≤ n
for each e ∈ E. Applying the notation used for S(N), we
˜
denote the network messages by (W (u→V) : (u, V) ∈ M) with
˜
˜ (u→V) ∈ W (u→V) . We denote the encoders and decoders
W
˜
for S(N) by f˜ and g. These mappings are related to the
˜
encoder and decoder mappings for S(N) as described below
and illustrated in Figure 3.
• For each e ∈ E, i ∈ {1, . . . , m + N|V| − 1}, and
˜
j ∈ {1, . . . , |T (e)|}, encoder f˜(e)
(i−1)n+ j in S(N) operates
(e)
encoder f[i+τ(e,1)−τ(e, j)],i+τ(e,1)−1 from S(N) for all e ∈ E.
If |T (e)| < n for some e ∈ V, encoder f˜(e)
(i−1)n+t transmits
symbol for all t ∈ {|T (e)| + 1, . . . , n}.
• At each v ∈ V, the decoder ﬁrst groups together
the received vectors corresponding to each S[i] (N) for
i = 1, 2, . . . , N|V|, decodes using the decoder functions
ˆ
˜
g(v) (·), and ﬁnally creates reconstructions (W (u→V,v) :
[i]
(u, V) ∈ M, v ∈ V) by passing through the decoders
(G(u→V) (·) : (u, V) ∈ M).
