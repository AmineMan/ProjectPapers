Abstract—Optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are widely used
as spreading codes in optical ﬁber networks. For reliable and
efﬁcient data transmission in these systems, it is required to
design OOCs with low correlation and large size. In this paper, we
present two new constructions for asymptotically optimal OOCs
with respect to the Johnson bound, whose maximum nontrivial
correlation value is 1. We ﬁrst construct an asymptotically
optimal OOC of length (p − 1)p2 for an odd prime p by using
the structure of the ring of integers modulo p2 . We then present
an asymptotically optimal OOC of length M p1 p2 from a product
of two ﬁnite ﬁelds, where p1 and p2 are odd primes, and M is
an integer such that M | pi − 1 for i = 1, 2.
Index Terms—Correlation, optical ﬁber networks, ﬁnite ﬁelds,
ring of integers modulo n, optical orthogonal codes (OOCs).

λ = max{λa , λc }.
In general, it is desireable that an OOC have large size and
small maximum correlation for a given length and a given
weight, if it is applied to OCDMA systems. However, there is
a tradeoff among the parameters of an OOC.
Theorem 2 ([5], Johnson bound). An (N, w, λa , λc )-OOC
with size L satisﬁes
L≤

In optical networks based on code-division multiple-access
(CDMA), optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are employed as
spreading codes. An OOC is a family of (0, 1)-sequences with
a constant weight, in which 1 means signal ‘on’ and 0 signal
‘off’ [1]-[4]. The use of OOCs with good correlation properties allows reliable and efﬁcient data transmission in optical
CDMA (OCDMA) networks. The mathematical deﬁnition of
an OOC is given in the following.

N →∞ L∗
where L∗ is the right-hand side of (1), it is referred to as
an asymptotically optimal OOC. In [3], Chung, Salehi, and
Wei presented a guideline for design of OOCs, and gave
some constructions of optimal OOCs. Since then, several
constructions for (asymptotically) optimal OOCs with small λ
have been reported in the literature (see [6]-[15]). Moreover,
Omrani and Kumar proposed two-dimensional OOCs which
spread both time and wavelength domain [17]. For a survey
of two-dimensional OOCs, we refer to [18].
In this paper, we present two new constructions for asymptotically optimal OOCs with λ = 1. We ﬁrst construct a
(p − 1)p2 , p − 1, 1, 1 -OOC with size p + 1 for an odd prime
p by using the structure of Zp2 , the ring of integers modulo
p2 . We then present an (M p1 p2 , M, 1, 1)-OOC with size
(p1 p2 − 1)/M from a product of two ﬁnite ﬁelds, where pi is
an odd prime and M is a positive integer such that M | pi − 1
for i = 1, 2. They have new parameters not covered in the
literature, as shown in Table I.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we
present a (p − 1)p2 , p − 1, 1, 1 -OOC from Zp2 . We construct a (M p1 p2 , M, 1, 1)-OOC with size (p1 p2 − 1)/M from
a product of two ﬁnite ﬁelds in Section III. Finally, we give
some concluding remarks in Section IV.

Deﬁnition 1. Let X = {Xi | 0 ≤ i ≤ L−1} be a set of (0, 1)sequences Xi = {Xi (t)}N −1 such that |{t | Xi (t) = 1, 0 ≤
t=0
t ≤ N − 1}| = w for any 0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1, where w ≥ 2. We
call w the weight of Xi , and L the size of X , respectively.
The correlation Λi,j (τ ) between Xi and Xj is deﬁned as

0≤i≤L−1,
1≤τ ≤N −1

N −1 N −2
N −λ
···

where λ = max{λa , λc } and x denotes the largest integer
less than or equal to x.

Any integer t with 0 ≤ t ≤ (p − 1)p2 − 1 can be uniquely
expressed as
t := (t0 , t1 )

Throughout the paper, we denote by x y the least nonnegative residue of x modulo y for an integer x and a positive
integer y. We also denote by Zn the ring of integers modulo n
for a positive integer n. The fuction I[x] is deﬁned as I[x] = 1
if x is true, and 0 otherwise.

where t0 = t p−1 and t1 = t p2 by the Chinese Remainder
Theorem. Using this representation and the structure of Zp2 ,
it is possible to construct an OOC of length (p − 1)p2 .

Construction A: For an odd prime p, let α be a primitive root
(k)
modulo p and p2 . For k = 0, 1, deﬁne Xk = {Xi | 0 ≤ i ≤
k

For an odd prime p and a positive integer n, there exists an
element α of Zpn such that the multiplicative group Z∗n =

where 0 ≤ t ≤ (p − 1)p2 − 1. Construct the OOC XA as

The element α is called a primitive root modulo pn . If α is
a primitive root modulo p2 , it is also a primitive root modulo
pn for any integer n ≥ 3. Moreover, it is extremely rare that
a primitive root modulo p is not a primitive root modulo p2
[19].
Throughout the section, we assume that α is not only a
primitive root modulo p, but also a primitive root modulo p2 .
Note that αi = 1 mod p for any 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 2, and αj = 1
mod p2 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ (p − 1)p − 1. Using the primitivity of
α modulo p and p2 , it is possible to derive the following four
lemmas which will be very useful in proving the optimality
of the OOCs obtained by Construction A. Their proofs are
included in the full version of this paper [20].

X A = X 0 ∪ X1 .
Theorem 7. The set XA in Construction A is a
(p − 1)p2 , p − 1, 1, 1 -OOC with size p + 1. Furthermore, it
is asymptotically optimal with respect to the Johnson bound.
Proof. It is obvious that the size of XA is p+1 by deﬁnition.
Let τ0 = τ p−1 and τ1 = τ p2 . For k, l ∈ {0, 1}, 0 ≤ i ≤

into four cases according to k and l.

Let Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld of q elements and F∗ = Fq \ {0},

where q is a prime power. Let α be a primitive element of Fq .
For a nonzero element β of Fq , we have β = αl for an integer
0 ≤ l ≤ q − 2. Throughout this section, we use the following
assumptions:
• p1 and p2 are two odd primes with p1 < p2 ;
• There exist two positive integers M and Li such that
pi = M Li + 1 for i = 1, 2; and
• αi is a primitive element of Fpi for i = 1, 2.
Let u = (u1 , u2 ) ∈ Fp1 × Fp2 , r = (r1 , r2 ) ∈ ZL1 × ZL2 , and
d = (0, d) ∈ ZM × ZM satisfy
• (u1 , u2 ) = (1, 0), (0, 1), or (1, 1);
• ri = 0 if ui = 0 for i = 1, 2; and
• d = 0 if either u1 = 0 or u2 = 0.
Let J be the set of all u : r : d = (u1 , u2 ) : (r1 , r2 ) : (0, d)

integer with 0 ≤ τ0 ≤ M − 1. Then

By summarizing the results of Cases i), ii), iii), and iv), we
can conclude that XA is a ((p − 1)p2 , p − 1, 1, 1)-OOC with
size p + 1. It is also easily checked that

Therefore, XB is a (M p1 p2 , M, 1, 1)-OOC by the results of
Cases i) and ii). It is asymptotically optimal with respect to
the Johnson bound since

when M → ∞.
IV. C ONCLUDING R EMARKS
We presented two asymptotically optimal OOCs with respect to the Johnson bound. One is based on the ring of
integers modulo p2 , and the other is constructed from the
product of two ﬁnite ﬁelds. Extending the results to more
general cases may be a challenging problem.
