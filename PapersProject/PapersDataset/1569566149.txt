is correlated (from block to block) with band-limited Doppler
spectrum in [−F, F ], 0 ≤ F < 1 , the ZF-achievable DoFs

reduce to M (1 − 2F ) [3]. On the other hand, Maddah-Ali and
Tse have shown that completely outdated CSIT is still useful
[1]. In particular, the MAT scheme achieves DoFs equal to
M
1
1 , if the overhead for estimating the channels at
1+ 2 +···+ M
the receivers is neglected. Motivated by this exciting result,
delayed CSIT has been extensively studied and its beneﬁt has
been demonstrated in different multi-user network systems
(see e.g. [5]). The main idea of these schemes is that the
knowledge of strictly causal channel state, no matter how it
is related to the current state, enables to align the interference
into a space and time subspace with a reduced dimension for
each receiver. A straightforward comparison between the two
DoFs given above shows that there exists a cross point at which
one scheme outperforms the other in the time-varying fading
channels. For a ﬁxed system dimension, e.g. M = 2, we may
choose ZF up to the Doppler frequency shift F < 1 such that
6
1 − 2F dominates 2 achieved by MAT, whereas we switch to
3
MAT for the larger Doppler frequency shift larger than 1 . As
6
the system dimension M increases, by approximating the DoF
M
achieved by MAT as ln M , we observe also that the cross point
1
approaches F = 2 . This means that ZF becomes beneﬁcial for
a wider range of the Doppler bandwidth.
Quantifying the relative merit of ZF and MAT is the focus
of this work. To this end, we shall explicitly account for:
(i) temporal correlation between neighboring fading blocks,
(ii) the resource overhead due to the forward training phases,
(iii) the CSI error at both the transmitter and receivers and its
impact on the achievable DoFs. We remark that (i) is motivated
by the following scenario: in a practical OFDM-based wireless
system protocol, the downlink resource blocks (tiles on the
time-frequency plane) are deﬁned a priori, independently of
the actual coherence bandwidth Wc and coherence time Tc ,
which depend on the scattering environment and the mobility
speed of the individual users. For the case of a ﬁxed resource
block length spanning T symbols, signiﬁcantly less than
Wc Tc , the channel coefﬁcients in subsequent blocks are generally correlated. For both ZF and MAT, we consider realistically
that CSIR is obtained via downlink training. Because the
imperfect CSIR is the basis of the feedback from users to
the base-station, this naturally degrades the quality of CSIT
(delayed or not). This shall be reﬂected in terms of (ii) the
downlink resource loss as well as (iii) the error in CSI at

Abstract—We compare two classes of linear precoding strategies, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the “MAT” scheme
recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse, over time-varying
MISO broadcast channels. For a temporally correlated fading
process with band-limited Doppler spectrum in [−F, F ], with
0 ≤ F < 1 , it has been shown that ZF achieves a fraction 1 − 2F
2
of the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF). On the other hand,
MAT exploits delayed channel state information at transmitter
(CSIT) and guarantees a constant DoF irrespectively of the
fading Doppler bandwidth. In this work, we compare the net
DoFs of both schemes by accounting for the correlation between
fading blocks and for the resource required for downlink channel
estimation. It is found that the downlink training for each receiver
to learn the CSI of the others might be detrimental for the
performance of MAT especially when the system size (number
of users and transmit antennas) is not much smaller than the
channel block length.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We consider the MISO broadcast channel with M transmit
antennas and K = M receivers with a single antenna each.
The observations for any channel use in block t are given by
yk [t] = hk [t]Hx[t] + nk [t], k = 1, . . . , K, t = 1, . . . , n (1)
where x [t] is the transmit vector satisfying the average power
x
constraint E[||x [t]||2 ] ≤ P ∀t, nk [t] ∼ NC (0, 1) is AWGN,
h
{h k [t]} are M × 1 channel vectors (from the transmitter
to the k-th receiver), distributed according to a temporally
correlated block-fading channel process. Namely, they remain
constant over a block of length T channel uses much smaller
than a coherence block (see the discussion later), and change
from block to block according to some stationary and ergodic
process. Notice that the fading evolution can be seen as a
“discrete-time” process by taking one sample per block. In
fact, (1) describes the channel at any channel use of the t-th
block. We omit the channel use index inside each block in
order to avoid clutter of notation, since it is irrelevant for the
following development. Under this setting, we consider two
classes of linear strategies, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and
the scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse [1], hereafter
called “MAT”. On one hand, ZF can achieve the optimal
degrees of freedom (DoF) of M at the price of timely and
accurate channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). It is
known that in order to maintain the optimal DoF the CSIT
error must decrease inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio P
[2]–[4]. Further, in the realistic case where the fading process

where z k [t] ∼ NC (0, I) is AWGN and Ttr , P γ denote the
length and the power of the common downlink training,
respectively for some training power allocation factor γ ≥ 1.
In our model, we assume that the users estimate their channels
based on common (i.e., multicasted to all users) downlink
training symbols. User k estimates its channel vector based
ˆ
on (6) and obtains the MMSE estimate h k [t] given by

Q
v1
where we let Q = [Q 1 , . . . , Q M ] and v = [v T , . . . , v T ]T . In
M
ZF, the transmitter sends M streams block by block (τ = 1).
The coded information symbols v k = vk (a scalar, in this
P
case) are independent, zero-mean and have variance M and
the precoding matrices Q k have dimension M × 1 (column
vectors) and are given by the columns of S −1 diag({ak }M ),
k=1
where the coefﬁcients ak are such that Q k 2 = 1.
In the MAT scheme, a block transmission consists of M
phases. In the j-th phase, the scheme sends (multicasts) orderj symbols, which must be decoded by j receivers, and it
generates the order-(j+1) symbols. The total number of coded
symbols sent to user k is M !, i.e., v k in (3) is an M !×1 vector.
By letting τj = M ! denote the length of phase j, the total
j
M
transmission takes τ = j=1 τj blocks. Thus, the number of
coded information symbols per channel use achieved by the
M
M
scheme is Mτ ! = 1+ 1 +···+ 1 , as anticipated before. For later

Q
where we let Qk = [Q 1 , . . . , Qk−1 , Qk+1 , . . . , QM ] denote
the submatrix corresponding to all receivers except k.
In order to compare two schemes, we consider that each
h
component of {h k [t]} follows a Doppler process, seen as
a discrete-time process with one sample per block, as said
previously. We let Sh (ξ) denote the channel process power
spectral density, strictly band-limited to [−F, F ] where 0 ≤
F < 1 denotes the maximum Doppler frequency shift, given
2
vfc Tf
by F =
c , with v, c, fc , and Tf denoting the mobile
speed [m/s], the light speed [m/s], the carrier frequency [Hz],
and the block duration [sec], respectively, and satisfying the
1/2
normalization −1/2 Sh (ξ)dξ = 1. In general, for both ZF and
MAT, each receiver k estimates h k [t] based on the sequence
of the observation available up to block t − d, given by

where y k = [yk [1], . . . , yk [τ ]]T , n k = [nk [1], . . . , nk [τ ]]T , and
hk
we let H k = diag({h H [t]}τ ) denote the corresponding τ ×
t=1
τ M block-diagonal matrix. We focus on a linear precoding
τM
strategy by forming the transmit vector x ∈ C
given by
x=

up to the previous j − 1 phase, i.e. t = i=1 τi . Due to the
i.i.d. assumption across antennas and users for each t, there
exists a precoding matrix Q simultaneously satisfying

The channel vectors {h k [t]} deﬁne the channel state at block

given block t, the M channel coefﬁcients are i.i.d. ∼ NC (0, 1)
across users and base station antennas. This implies that
S
rank(S [t]) = M with probability 1.
Under this setting, let us consider the observation over τ

use, we let Tj = { i=1 τi + 1, i=1 τi + 2, . . . , i=1 τi } be
the time indices corresponding to phase j. We let Q k,j , of
dimension τj M × M !, denote the precoding matrix for user k
Qk,1
at phase j and let Q k = [Q T , . . . , Q T ]T by stacking over
k,M
phase j = 1, . . . , M .
Q
In the MAT scheme, the matrices {Q k } are designed as
follows. In phase 1, the transmitter simply sends M ! order-one
symbols to each of M receivers with no CSIT, using TDMA.
This yields:

the transmitter and receivers. Finally, we remark that these
relevant questions have been addressed in the literature [6], [7].
In particular, [6] considered a ﬁnite-rate delayed feedback to
compare ZF, MAT and TDMA. Although it partially captures
the temporal channel variation by the size of a block length
(assumed equal to the coherence time), their model lacks
these aspects. By ignoring (i) the transmitter is assumed to
wait for the feedback sent by the users in each block. This
incurs a signiﬁcant resource loss (delay) for ZF. Further,
the feedback quantization error is the sole source of CSIT
degradation while CSIR is assumed to be perfect and obtained
for free (no downlink training). In contrast, we argue that
downlink estimation and CSIR quality are the major sources
of degradation and training overhead, while a well-designed
analog or digital feedback yields no DoFs degradation, as
we shown in [3]. Our numerical examples have shown that
the performance of MAT degrades rather quickly for a large
system dimension and for a ﬁnite block length. This is due
to the need of multiuser training, where every receiver learns
the delayed CSI of the other receivers. Such effects have been
neglected in [6].

B. MAT under imperfect CSI
In order to perform the MAT algorithm, we require that the
transmitter knows delayed CSI of phase j at the beginning
of phase j + 1 while each receiver knows its channel at each
block t. In addition to its own channel state, each user needs
to know the other users’ state for coherent detection. To this
end, after the last phase, i.e. at block t = τ + 1, the sequence
S t=1
of the state matrices {S [t]}τ must be known to all users. We
consider the following channel training/feedback procedure
such that both the transmitter and receivers learn the CSI
speciﬁed above.
1) Common training: In phase j, only M − j + 1 antennas
are switched on for j = 1, . . . , M . Hence, the transmitter
sends pilot symbols such that all M receivers estimate
M − j + 1 components of the respective channel vector.
Namely, we have the size of the common training given
by Ttr,j ≥ M − j + 1.
2) Precoding selection: In phase 1, the transmitter sends
M!
M symbol vectors v 1 , . . . , v M ∈ C
in TDMA mode
according to (4). In phase j ≥ 2, the transmitter sends
order-j symbols, a linear combination of the overheard
signals during phase j − 1, through the precoding maˆ
ˆ
ˆ
trices Q 1,j , . . . , Q K,j , as a function of {S [t]} up to
j−1
t = i=1 τi [1, Section III.C].
3) Feedback: At each block, each receiver k sends its
ˆ
estimated channel state hk [t] to the transmitter. Since
the takes place in the uplink, it does not consume the
downlink resource.
4) Data transmission: at each block t = 1, . . . , τ , the
transmitter sends the useful signals v 1 , . . . , v M within the
remaining T − maxj Ttr,j = T − M channel uses.
5) Multiuser training: After the last M -th phase, the multiuser training symbols are sent. The transmitter sends
M −j vectors of dimension M −j +1 necessary for each
block of phase j, irrespectively of the side information
that each user might have 2 . The training length for any
block of phase j is given by

IV. N UMERICAL EXAMPLES AND C ONCLUSIONS
We numerically evaluate the achievable DoF with ZF and
MAT given respectively in (15) and (28). By ﬁxing the carrier
frequency fc = 2 [GHz], the block duration Tf = 1 [msec],
we vary the block length T = Tf Wf by considering different
block bandwidth Wf , sufﬁciently smaller than the coherence
bandwidth Wc . In Fig. 2, we plotted the achievable DoF as a
function of the block size T in channel uses for M = 4. We
observe that ZF outperforms MAT up to a high speed v ≤ 140
[km/h] over the range of the block size considered here. In Fig.
3, we plotted the achievable DoF as a function of the system
dimension M for a block size of T = 180. We see immediately
that the overhead due to the multiuser training dominates the
M
ln M increase of MAT scheme. Our model, which captures
the temporal correlation between blocks and the cost due to
the downlink training, makes the performance of MAT more
pessimistic than [6]. The analysis in this work can be extended
by characterizing the achievable downlink spectral efﬁciency
for a given uplink resource as in [8].
