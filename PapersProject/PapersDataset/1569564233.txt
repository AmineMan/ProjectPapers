Abstract—Consider a binary modulo-additive noise channel
with noiseless feedback. When the noise is a stationary and
ergodic process Z, the capacity is 1 − H(Z) (H(·) denoting
the entropy rate). It is shown analogously that when the noise
is a deterministic sequence z ∞ , the capacity under ﬁnite-state
encoding and decoding is 1 − ρ(z ∞ ), where ρ(·) is Lempel
and Ziv’s ﬁnite-state compressibility. This quantity is termed
the porosity σ(·) of an individual noise sequence. A sequence
of schemes are presented that universally achieve porosity for
any noise sequence. These results may be interpreted both as
a channel-coding counterpart to Ziv and Lempel’s work in
universal source coding, as well as an extension of the work by
Lomnitz and Feder and Shayevitz and Feder on communication
across modulo-additive channels.

Universal channel coding with noiseless feedback.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Traditionally, universal source coding has been subject to
more attention than universal channel coding. The reason for
this discrepancy is apparent from Fig. 1. While a source
encoder may adjust its encoding to better suit the unknown
source, the channel encoder of Fig. 1 has no observation of
the unknown channel and is therefore unable to adapt. One
may ask for an adaptive decoder, but this leads to a much
weaker kind of universality (see, for instance, [1]–[3]).
However, if a noiseless feedback link is added to the system
(Fig. 2), both encoder and decoder may adjust to the channel.
This permits a level of universality more comparable with that
of universal source coding. To draw an even stronger parallel,
consider the modulo-additive channel of Fig. 3: one may
compare the uncharacterized source of universal compression
to the uncharacterized noise of this setting.
Ziv and Lempel’s seminal work [4], [5] can be considered
the canonical treatment of universality in source coding. We
ﬁnd that an analogous set of questions yields an analogous set
of answers for the modulo-additive channel with feedback:

A. Related Work
The notion of competitive universality in channel coding is
introduced by Lomnitz and Feder in [6]. The reference class
consists of iterated ﬁxed-blocklength (IFB) schemes, which
ignore the feedback channel and simply employ block coding
across the noisy channel. Rate-adaptive schemes, on the other
hand, communicate a ﬁxed number of bits over at most n
channel uses. It is proven that IFB schemes can do no better
than porosity (rate 1 − ρ(z ∞ )), and a rate-adaptive scheme
built upon LZ78 is shown to achieve porosity.
In a sense, the results reported here take these statements
of competitive optimality a step further: we ask that the
achievability schemes not only outperform any elements of
the reference class, but that they are elements of the reference
class. As IFB codes frequently cannot even achieve porosity
for a given noise sequence z ∞ , this requires that the reference
class be widened to the class of all ﬁnite-state schemes.
In [7], Shayevitz and Feder establish the original results that
have sparked much of the subsequent work in this problem.
They construct variable-rate, ﬁxed-blocklength schemes, and
then demonstrate that these schemes achieve for any noise
sequence the empirical capacity, or one minus the ﬁrstorder empirical entropy. We ﬁnd that the universal porosityachieving schemes {F m } may be constructed from these
empirical-capacity-achieving schemes. Note that the achievability structure of [6] is in spirit very similar, but the
performance guarantees of Shayevitz and Feder prove more
adaptable to the metrics of interest here.
Eswaran et al. [8] extend [7] to demonstrate that even when
the feedback is asymptotically zero-rate, the empirical capacity
may be still be achieved universally.

Lempel and Ziv take universality to its logical extreme by
allowing the source to be any individual sequence. Here
the noise z ∞ is permitted to be any individual sequence.
For a given source sequence x∞ , Lempel and Ziv show
that no ﬁnite-state encoder/decoder can achieve a compression rate smaller than the compressibility of x∞ .
Analogously, the converse results here show that no
ﬁnite state communication scheme can exceed the noise
sequence’s porosity.
Lempel and Ziv construct ﬁnite-state compression
schemes that achieve the compressibility for any source
sequence. The ﬁnite-state communication schemes {F m }
(Sec. IV) serve an identical function here.

A. Finite-state Schemes
A ﬁnite-state (FS) encoder/decoder scheme for an additive
noise channel — depicted in Fig. 4 — consists of several
components:
1) An encoder state variable s(e) and decoder state variable
i
s(d) , each taking values in a ﬁnite set S.
i
2) A source pointer pi and a ﬁnite lookahead constant .
3) An iid common randomness source θi ∼ pθ taking
values in a ﬁnite alphabet.
p
4) An encoding function xi = e(s(e) , Mpii + , yi , θi ) ∈ X .
i
5) A decoding length function Li = dL (s(d) , yi , θi ) that
i
also determines the update of the source pointer: pi+1 =
pi + L i .
p
6) A decoding function Mpii +Li −1 = dM (s(d) , yi , θi ).
i
7) State-update functions for both the encoder
p
s(e)
=
f(e) (s(e) , Mpii + , yi , θi ) and decoder
i+1
i
(d)
(d)
si+1 = f(d) (si , yi , θi ).
At each time step, the encoding function determines the
input xi to the channel, the decoding function estimates the
ﬁrst Li source symbols that have yet to be estimated (based
on the output yi of the channel), and state variables and the
source pointer location are updated in anticipation of the next
transmission.
One may attempt to somewhat generalize class FS by allowing for active feedback. The class of ﬁnite-state active feedback
(FSAF) schemes accomplishes this: rather than feedback yi−1 ,
the encoder is provided with the output ui ∈ X of an
arbitrary ﬁnite-state feedback channel p(u|yi−1 , s(f) ). Note
i−1
that if ui = yi−1 this reduces to class FS.
In [9] Lemma 9, it is shown that the class of FSAF
schemes is actually equivalent to class FS. The two families
may therefore be used interchangeably. For convenience, the
converse is proved for class FS, while the achievability scheme
given is of class FSAF.
Observe that FS/FSAF are sufﬁciently general to include
the following as special cases:
1) The class of “iterated ﬁxed-length” block schemes, as
deﬁned by Lomnitz and Feder [6]. These are simply
block codes that ignore the feedback. The common

The kth order block-by-block empirical entropy is indicated

pirical entropy is similarly written as Hsw (xn ) = Hpk (X k ).

As shown by Ziv and Lempel [5], the ﬁnite-state compressibility of a sequence x∞ may be written as

ρ(x∞ ) = lim sup lim sup Hsw (xn ).

An analagous quantity may also be introduced:
ˆk
ρ(x∞ ) = lim inf lim inf Hsw (xn ).

By Lemma 1 in [9], both expressions may also be written in
terms of the block-by-block empirical entropy.
Operationally, compressibility is the smallest limit supremum compression ratio achievable for a sequence (Theorem 3
in [5]). It is not difﬁcult to show, in an analogous manner, that
(2) is the smallest possible limit inﬁmum compression ratio.
Informed by this, we refer to the original compressibility quantity as the worst-case compressibility and the newly introduced
limit inﬁmum version as the best-case compressibility.
The porosity of a noise sequence z ∞ ∈ Z ∞ is deﬁned in
best-case σ(z ∞ ) = log2 |Z|−ρ(z ∞ ) and worst-case σ(z ∞ ) =
log2 |Z| − ρ(z ∞ ) varieties as well. This name is chosen in
analogy with other individual noise sequence properties, such
as compressibility and predictability, to reﬂect the passage of
information through a noise sequence. In the remainder of this
paper, the operational signiﬁcance of porosity is clariﬁed.
II. P ROBLEM S TATEMENT
A deterministic additive noise feedback channel, as depicted
in Fig. 3, is deﬁned by a noise sequence z ∞ ∈ X ∞ , where
X is a ﬁnite alphabet with a modulo addition operator. The
channel output at any time i is given by the sum of the noise
and the input: yi = xi + zi . Noiseless feedback ui = yi−1

2

randomness at encoder and decoder allows for randomly
generated block codes as well.
2) Schemes that transmit a variable number of source symbols over a ﬁxed number of channel uses, before reseting
their state variables and repeating the operation (deﬁned
more precisely in Sec. IV as “repetition schemes”).
3) Schemes that transmit a variable (or ﬁxed) number of
source symbols over a variable (but bounded) number
of channel uses (including “rate-adaptive” schemes [6]).
Secondly, notice that without certain restrictions in the
deﬁnition of class FS, the problem can become trivial:
1) Suppose that the encoder is permitted to be inﬁnitestate. The system designer may then design the encoder
(e)
state si so that the channel input at time i is given
by e(i, Mpi ) = Mpi − zi . The decoder needs merely
read the channel output to obtain the message at the
maximum possible rate, log |X |.
2) Suppose that the decoder is permitted to be inﬁnitestate. One may reverse the above construction by having
the encoder blindly send the message bits through the
channel e(Mpi ) = Mpi and asking the decoder to cancel
out the noise. Once again, the maximum rate log |X | can
be achieved for any given noise sequence z ∞ .
3) Finally, suppose that the ﬁnite-lookahead requirement
is nonexistant — that is, the encoding function can
look at the entire untransmitted message stream xi =
∞
e(s(e) , Mpi , yi , θi ). This is identical to allowing the
i
encoder an inﬁnite number of states: if M ∞ is a
Bernoulli(1/2) sequence, then with probability one there
exists a one-to-one map between Mi∞ and i.

Observe that the randomness in these deﬁnitions has two
possible sources: the source sequence M ∞ and the commoninformation sequence θ∞ used by the FS scheme. Sometimes
the source M ∞ will be a ﬁxed sequence, but this is always
made clear from context.
C. Summary of Results
The results of this paper are summarized below. Note that
while these statements are specialized for the binary-alphabet
case, they can easily and intuitively generalize to any ﬁnite
alphabet with an addition operation.
1) A converse that upper-bounds the best-case achievable
rate by an FS scheme.
2) A converse that upper-bounds the worst-case achievable
rate by an FS scheme.
3) A sequence of universal FS schemes {F m }∞ that
m=1
simultaneously achieve the best-case and worst-case
converse bounds for any noise sequence z ∞ .
Formally, each of these three statements corresponds to a
theorem:
Theorem 1: Suppose an FS scheme best-case p-achieves
(R, ). If p > 0, then
R ≤ hb ( ) + σ(z ∞ ).
Theorem 2: Suppose an FS scheme worst-case p-achieves
(R, ). If p > 0, then
R ≤ hb ( ) + σ(z ∞ ).
Theorem 3: For an iid Bernoulli(1/2) source M ∞ and
noise sequence z ∞ , the scheme F m best-case achieves

We consider two interpretations of these quantities.
Best-Case. An FS scheme best-case p-achieves rate/error
(R, ) for a noise sequence z ∞ if with at least probability
p there exists a sequence of points {ni } ∈ Z+ such that
limi→∞ Rni ≥ R and limi→∞ ni ≤ . In other words, a
performance monitor that observes the system at the “right”
times will see it achieve (R, ) with probability at least p. If p
is 1, we say that the scheme simply best-case achieves (R, ).
Worst-Case. An FS scheme worst-case p-achieves
rate/error (R, ) if with at least probability p both
lim inf n→∞ Rn ≥ R and lim supn→∞ n ≤ . In other
words, a performance monitor observing the system at any
set of sample times will see it achieve (R, ) with probability
at least p. If p is one the scheme is said to worst-case achieve
(R, ).

A. Deﬁnitions and Limiting-Distribution Lemma
In order to prove the converse theorems, a series of deﬁnitions and a useful lemma are ﬁrst required.
Deﬁnition 1: Let {Li }∞ be a bounded sequence of noni=1
negative integers, and let M ∞ , z ∞ , and θ∞ as usual denote
ﬁnite-alphabet sequences. The k-partition of (M ∞ , z ∞ , θ∞ )
according to {Li } is the sequence of blocks

In this context, {Li } are referred to as the partition lengths.
Deﬁnition 2: Let x∞ be a sequence of symbols drawn from
a ﬁnite alphabet X . If there exists a series of sample points
{ni }∞ such that the sequence p1 (x)[xni ] converges to a

for x∞ .
Observe that for any ﬁnite-alphabet sequence x∞ at least
one limiting distribution exists: Since p1 (x)[xn ] is an inﬁnite
ˆ
sequence in a compact set, at least one convergent subsequence
must exist.
Deﬁnition 3: Let z ∞ and θ∞ be ﬁnite-alphabet sequences.
The set Mk (z ∞ , θ∞ ) consists of all binary sequences
M ∞ such that there exist partition lengths {Li }, a resulting k-partition {(M Li , z k , θk )i }, and a limiting distribution
p(L, M L , z k ) for the sequence {Li , (M L , z k )i } such that

Lemma 4: Let z ∞ be a ﬁxed binary sequence, let M ∞

be a ﬁnite-alphabet sequence of arbitrary distribution that
is independent of M ∞ . Then the probability that M ∞ ∈
Mk ((zi , θi )∞ ) is zero for any k.

B. Proof of Converse
Although the converse results are presented as two distinct
theorems, at their heart is the same argument.
Lemma 5: Suppose an s-state -lookahead FS scheme
achieves (R, ) on points {ni } for a speciﬁc source sequence
M ∞ , a speciﬁc channel noise sequence z ∞ , and a speciﬁc
encoder/decoder common information sequence θ∞ . If for
some k ∈ Z+ M ∞ is not a member of Mk ((zi , θi )∞ ), and

IV. ACHIEVABILITY

Proof: The general idea in proving this lemma is to
turn any given FS scheme into a source encoding/decoding
scheme. Consider an FS decoder that achieves (R, ) on some
points {ni }, and ignore the minor complication of common
randomness θ∞ . Given only the channel output y ∞ , the
decoder produces an estimate of the source sequence M ∞ .
Knowing the source sequence and the channel output, the
decoder is technically capable of “simulating” the encoder
and thereby obtaining both the channel input sequence x∞
and the noise sequence z ∞ . One may therefore interpret the
channel output y ∞ as an encoding of the joint source sequence
(M ∞ , z ∞ ). In [9], an argument inspired by this intuition
proves the lemma.
Armed with Lemma 5, it is a relatively straightforward
matter to prove Theorems 1 and 2.
Proof of Theorem 1: We ﬁrst note that because θ∞ is drawn
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
iid and z ∞ is ﬁxed, H k (z n ) + H k (θn ) − H k ((zi , θi )n ) → 0
i=1
with probability one for every k. Furthermore, by Lemma 4,
M ∞ ∈ Mk ((zi , θi )∞ ) with probability one for every k.

Therefore, if (R, ) is best-case-achieved with positive probability, it must then be achieved for some speciﬁc (M ∞ , θ∞ )

such that M ∞ ∈ Mk ((zi , θi )∞ and H k (z n ) + H k (θn ) −

To construct the universal achievability schemes {F m },
the ﬁnite-extent and ﬁrst-order-empirical-capacity results of
Shayevitz and Feder [7] must be extended to inﬁnite-extent and
m-th-order empirical capacity. We start by introducing a new
subclass of FSAF (repetition schemes), then build an element
of this class using the communication scheme of Shayevitz
and Feder, and ﬁnally prove that this construction achieves
porosity.
A. Repetition schemes
A ﬁnite-extent (FE) scheme F for a channel with alphabet
X consists of:
1) An extent n.
2) A feedback channel with transition probabilities given
by Ui ∼ pui (ui |ui−1 , y i ) and taking values in X , for
i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
3) A common randomness variable θ drawn from a ﬁnite
alphabet, independent of the source, and provided to
both encoder and decoder.
4) Encoding functions x1
=
e1 (M ∞ , θ), x2
=
∞
∞
e2 (M , θ, u1 ), . . . , xn = en (M , θ, un−1 ).

5) A decoding length function L = dL (y n , θ, un−1 ), upper
bounded by n log |X |.
6) A decoding function M L = dM (y n , θ, un−1 ).
Note that an FE scheme is not a member of classes FS or
FSAF — both of which are inﬁnite-extent.
A repetition scheme is constructed from an n-extent ﬁnite
extent scheme F . Let F (M ∞ , z n ) describe the application
of scheme F to source M ∞ and noise block z n . Then the
repetition scheme F consists of repeated independent uses of
F , i.e. F (M ∞ , z ∞ ) is given by

for any z N (m) ∈ X N (m) and M ∞ ∈ {0, 1}∞, and where
m → 0.
Proof: For a given m, consider the m-tuple supersymbol channel characterized by inputs Xi = xim
(i−1)m+1 ,
im
noise Zi = z(i−1)m+1 , and outputs Yi = (x(i−1)m+1 +
z(i−1)m+1 , x(i−1)m+2 + z(i−1)m+2 , . . . , xim + zim ). Applying
Lemma 7 to channels of this alphabet yields a sequence of
schemes Fn ({0, 1}m) with
n,m

(8)

By (8) we may choose N (m) so that N (m),m → 0.
m→∞
Denoting F m = FN (m) ({0, 1}m), this proves the lemma.
The sequence of ﬁnite-extent schemes {F m }∞ form the
m=1
basis of the universal achievability construction.
Deﬁnition 4: The universal achievability scheme of order
m is the repetition scheme F m formed from the N (m)-extent
scheme F m .

L1 +n
n
n
2n
F ((M1 , 0∞ ), z1 ) , F (ML1 +1 , 0∞ ), zn+1 , . . . .

In each block, F is applied to a “virtual source” consisting of
the ﬁrst n bits of the source that have yet to be transmitted
and a string of 0s.
Proposition 6: The class of repetition schemes is a subclass
of FSAF schemes (and therefore of FS schemes).
This follows directly from two properties of repetition
schemes:
• The block-based structure allows for implementation with
ﬁnite-state machines.
• A repetition scheme constructed from an n-extent FE
scheme has ﬁnite lookahead constant n.

C. Proving achievability
Corollary 8 identiﬁes two types of “error” events in the
application of {F m } to a single block: a failure of the rate to
exceed the threshold 1 − H 1 (z n ) − (n) and an error in the
reconstruction. Let the indicators for these events in the ith
block be known as Ti and Ei respectively. In proving Theorem
3, the probability guarantees for Ei (6) and Ti (7) must be
connected to the relevant performance metrics: best-case rate,
worst-case rate, and worst-case error.
While neither sequence E ∞ nor T ∞ is independent (nor
identically distributed), both possess certain Markov properties
L
with respect to the source bits M(i) used in each block. This
allows for statements regarding the limiting weighted averages
n
1
of each of these sequences: e.g. lim supn→∞ n i=1 αi Ei ≤
n
1
m lim supn→∞ n
i=1 αi with probability one. These limiting statements, in turn, can be leveraged to prove the performance guarantees of Theorem 3. For the full proof, see [9].

B. Constructing schemes {F m }

At the core of the achievability scheme is a lemma, introduced by Shayevitz and Feder [7]:
Lemma 7: (Shayevitz and Feder, 2009) Let X be a ﬁnite
alphabet with an addition operation. Then there exists a
sequence of n-extent FE schemes Fn (X ) with the following
worst-case performance guarantees. For any additive noise
sequence z ∞ ∈ X ∞ and source sequence M ∞ ∈ {0, 1}∞,
P M L = M L ≤ (n)

→ 0.

sequences, this may be replaced by higher-order empirical
entropies.
Corollary 8: For binary additive noise channels with feedback, there exists a sequence of ﬁnite extent schemes F m
with extents N (m) → ∞ and the following performance
guarantees:
P ML = ML ≤ m
