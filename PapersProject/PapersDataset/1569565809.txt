Functional-Repair-by-Transfer Regenerating Codes
Kenneth W. Shum and Yuchong Hu

Abstract—
In a distributed storage system, a data ﬁle is
distributed to several storage nodes, such that the original ﬁle
can be decoded from any subset of the storage nodes of size
larger than or equal to a certain threshold. Upon the failure of a
storage node, we would like to regenerate it with minimal amount
of data transmissions from the surviving nodes to the new node.
This performance metric is called the repair-bandwidth. Another
performance metric is the disk input/output (I/O) cost, which
measures the number of bits a storage node needs to read out
from its memory in order to repair the failed node. In this paper,
we give examples of linear regenerating codes with minimal disk
I/O cost and repair-bandwidth, without any linear mixing in the
helping storage nodes.

packet in each storage node is an uncoded packet, the second
one is the sum of two packets, with addition performed in F2 ,
the ﬁnite ﬁeld of size 2. Let x ⊕ y denote the unique integer
z ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} such that x + y ≡ i mod 4. The parity-check
packets in nodes i ⊕ 2 is the sum of the uncoded packets in
node i and node i⊕1. One can verify that the four information
packets can be decoded from any two nodes. For example,
from nodes 1 and 3, packets A and C can be obtained directly,
and packet B (resp. D) can be decoded by adding packet A
(resp. C) to A+B (resp. C +D). If node 1 fails, we can repair
it by downloading packets D + A from node 2, packet C from
node 3, and packet D from node 4. Packet A can be recovered
by adding packets D + A and D, and packet C + D can be
recovered by adding packets C and D. By the cyclic structure
of the code, nodes 2, 3 and 4 can be repaired similarly. We
also note that data update can be performed efﬁciently; should
an information packet be updated, we only need to modify one
uncoded packet and two parity-check packets in the system.
The above example falls under the category of exact repair.
In this paper, we consider functional repair. Regenerating
codes for functional repair in general is given in Section II and
the repair-by-transfer subclass is discussed in Section III. A
family of repair-by-transfer regenerating codes for functional
repair is detailed in Section IV.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Regenerating codes, as introduced by Dimakis et al. in [2],
is a class of erasure codes for distributed storage systems. A
source data ﬁle is encoded across the storage nodes such that
a data collector can decode the source data ﬁle by connecting
to a fraction of the storage nodes. Should a storage node fail,
the failed node can be repaired by downloading some data
packets from the surviving nodes. The aim of the design of
regenerating codes is to minimize the the total trafﬁc required
in the repair process.
Besides the bandwidth requirement, another metric that
arises in practice is the disk I/O cost: we want to minimize the
number of bits that a surviving node must read out from its
memory during the repair of the failed node. In the extreme
case where disk I/O cost is minimal, the number of bits
read out from the memory is exactly equal to the number
of bits to be sent out. Data combining is only required in
the receiving end. Regenerating code with minimal disk I/O
cost is called a repair-by-transfer regenerating code. Some
constructions of repair-by-transfer regenerating codes attaining
minimum repair-bandwidth can be found in [3], [4]. In this
paper, we will consider minimum-storage regenerating codes.
This class of regenerating codes ﬁnd applications in multiplecloud storages [5].
We give an example of repair-by-transfer regenerating code,
which has the same parameters as in the example in [2, Fig. 2],
but linear combining is not required in the surviving storage
nodes. The encoding of packets are shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst

II. N ETWORK C ODES FOR D ISTRIBUTED S TORAGE
Let n be the number of storage nodes. A data ﬁle of size M
is encoded and distributed to the n storage nodes. The amount
of data stored in each node is denoted by α. We divide the
time into stages. Initially, the system start at stage 0. After a
node failure in stage t, the failed node is repaired and the time
is advanced to the (t + 1)-st stage. The design objectives of
regenerating code for distributed storage network (DSN) are:
(Node repair) Upon the failure of a storage node in stage t,
we recover it by setting up a newcomer, who contacts any d
surviving nodes, called the helpers, and downloads β units of
data from each of them. The total amount of data transmitted
from the helpers is called the repair-bandwidth, and is denoted
by γ = dβ.

stage t, and superscript T for the transpose operator.) The
packets stored within the i-th node in the t-th stage are the
(t)
components in Gi m. The DSN is initialized such that at
stage 0, the global encoding vectors in any k storage nodes
form a full-rank matrix.
Suppose that node i fails in stage t, and the helpers are
nodes h1 , h2 , . . . , hd . For j = 1, 2, . . . , d, helper hj sends β
(t)
packets to the newcomer. Let Fhd be the β ×α local encoding
matrix of helper hd at stage t. The packets sent from helper
hd to the newcomer are the components in

original data ﬁle by downloading from any k storage nodes.
We call this property the (n, k) recovery property. If α is equal
to M/k, which is the minimum possible value for α, then the
system is said to be maximal-distance separable (MDS).
Any code which realizes the (n, k) recovery property and
repairs a failed node by connecting to d surviving nodes is
called an (n, d, k) regenerating code, or simply a regenerating
code if the parameters are understood from the context.
There are two modes of repair. The ﬁrst one is called functional repair and the second one is exact repair. In functional
repair, the content of the newcomer is not necessarily the same
as the content in the failed storage nodes. Only the (n, k)
recovery property is preserved. In exact repair, the content of
the newcomer should be exactly the same as in the failed node.
For a given α, there is a fundamental limit for the repair
cost measured in terms of the repair-bandwidth. For functional
repair, a lower bound of repair-bandwidth can be derived via
the max-ﬂow bound for single-source multicasting [2]. In the
MDS case, the lower bound on repair-bandwidth is given by,

It is proved in [6] that for functional repair, the lower bound
of repair-bandwidth in (1) can be achieved by linear network
code over a ﬁxed ﬁnite ﬁeld. In the following, we describe
the realization of regenerating codes by linear network codes.
Let q be a prime power and let the ﬁnite ﬁeld of size q be
denoted by Fq . The parameters B, α and β of the DSN are
all integers. In the following, we will refer to an element in
Fq as a packet as well.
The ﬁle is divided into many stripes of data, each consisting
of B packets. Each stripe of data will be encoded in the same
way. In the remaining of this paper we will focus on one stripe
of data, and suppose that the data ﬁle consists of B packets,
m1 , m2 , . . . , mB . These B symbols are called the message
symbols.
Each of the n storage nodes stores α packets, obtained by
taking some linear combinations of the message symbols. The
vector formed by the B coefﬁcients of the linear combination
associated to a packet is called the global encoding vector of
the packet. In the t-th stage, we denote the global encoding
vector of the j-th packet stored in the i-th node by Γt (i, j),
for i = 1, 2, . . . , n and j = 1, 2, . . . , α. Thus, the j-th packet
in the i-th node is equal to the dot product of Γt (i, j) and
[m1 m2 . . . mB ]. We call (i, j) the index of the vector Γt (i, j).
We will view Γt (i, j) as a function, mapping an index (i, j)
to a global encoding vector in stage t. The deﬁnition of Γt
is extended as a function with sets of indices as domain by
deﬁning
Γt (X ) := {Γt (x) : x ∈ X }

If we want to repair the DSN exactly, the encoding matrix
(t+1)
(t)
Gj
should equal Gj for all j. For functional repair, we
just want to maintain the (n, k) recovery property, namely, at
any stage and in any set of k storage nodes, the rank of the
kα global encoding vectors is equal to B.
III. R EPAIR - BY-T RANSFER FOR F UNCTIONAL R EPAIR
In a repair-by-transfer regenerating code, we choose the
(t)
local encoding matrix Fhj such that there is exactly one 1 in
each row, while the other entries are all zero. In the remaining
of this paper, we will focus on (n, n − 1, 2) repair-by-transfer
regenerating codes for functional repair, with parameters
d = n − 1,
k = 2,
B = k(d + 1 − k) = 2(n − 2),
α = B/k = n − 2, and
β = 1,
i.e., any two storage nodes are sufﬁcient in rebuilding the
original ﬁle, and each node stores B/2 packets (the MDS
case). Any regenerating code with the above parameters is
optimal with respect to the bound in (1).
For repair-by-transfer regenerating code with the above
(t)
parameters, the local encoding matrix Fj is a zero-one row
vector. If node ℓt fails in stage t, for j ̸= ℓt , we let χ(t, ℓt , j)
(t)
be the index of the unique “1” in Fj , i.e., node j sends

for any set of indices X .
(t)
Let Gi be the α × B encoding matrix whose rows are
precisely the global encoding vectors Γt (i, 1), . . . , Γt (i, α),
and m be the column vector [m1 m2 . . . mB ]T . (We will
use superscript (t) to indicate that a variable associated with

the choice function, and takes value between 1 and α. Let

For integer j between 1 and n, let
St (ℓt , j) := Cj ∪ Rt (ℓt ).

Rt (ℓt ) := {(j, χ(t, ℓt , j) : j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} \ {ℓt }}

The set St (ℓt , j) is interpreted as the index set of the packets
of node j and the packets used in repairing node ℓt in stage t.
Continued from Example 1, we have

be the set of indices of the global encoding vectors used in
the repair of node ℓt .
For example, in Fig. 1, if node 1 fails, we can repair
node 1 using packets C, A + C, and B + C from nodes 2,
3, and 4, respectively. The choice function is χ(t, 1, 2) = 1,
χ(t, 1, 3) = 1 and χ(t, 1, 4) = 2, and we have Rt (4) =
{(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2)}.
In case node ℓt fails in stage t, the repair-by-transfer process
consists of the following steps:
(i) For j ̸= ℓt , node j sends the χ(t, ℓt , j)-th packet in its
memory to the newcomer.
(ii) Put the packets received by the newcomer together as a
column vector and multiply it by an α×(n−1) local encoding
(t)
matrix Hℓt . Update the global encoding matrix of the newly
reconstructed node to

Graphically, these four sets of indices can be illustrated by the

The (n, 2) property requires that for any t, the global encoding
vectors indexed by Ci,j , with i ̸= j, in stage t are linearly
independent.

Suppose that the (n, 2) recovery property holds in stage t. In
order to maintain the (n, 2) recovery property after the repair
of node ℓt , we need to check that each of the following sets of
global encoding vectors Γt+1 (Cℓt ,j ), for j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} \
{ℓt }, are linearly independent. (We do not need to check
Γt+1 (Cj,j ′ ) for j ̸= ℓt ̸= j ′ because Γt (Cj,j ′ ) = Γt+1 (Cj,j ′ ).)
We make the following observations for j ̸= ℓt :
(i) Each vector in Γt+1 (Cℓt ,j ) can be obtained as a linear
combination of the vectors in Γt (St (ℓt , j)). Therefore, if the
vectors in Γt (St (ℓt , j)) are linearly dependent, then the vectors
in Γt+1 (Cℓt ,j ) are also linearly dependent.
(ii) If the vectors in Γt (St (ℓt , j)) are linearly independent,
(t)
then we can choose a local encoding matrix Hℓt in stage t
such that the vectors in Γt+1 (Cℓt ,j ) are linearly independent.
In fact, we can use a (n − 2) × (n − 1) matrix H whose
(r, s)-entry is
{
1 s = r, or s = r + 1
H(r, s) =
0 otherwise,

We note that for ℓt ̸= j, the set St (ℓt , j) consists of 2(n −
2) elements, because |Cj | = n − 2, |Rt (ℓt )| = n − 1, and
|Cj ∩ Rt (ℓt )| = 1. When ℓt = j, |St (ℓt , j)| = 2n − 3.

(iii) Determine the choice function for the repair in the next
stage, χ(t + 1, i′ , j ′ ), for i′ ̸= ℓt and j ′ ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α} \ {i′ }.
We introduce some notations. Let

. This matrix works because after

eliminating any column matrix, the resulting square matrix has
(t)
full rank. This proves that for each j ̸= ℓt , we can choose Hℓt
such that a newcomer in the next stage can decode the original
data ﬁle from the packets in nodes j and ℓt .
A standard application of the Schwartz-Zippel’s lemma in
(t)
network coding theory [7] shows that there is a choice of Hℓt
such that all data collectors in the next stage are satisﬁed, if
the ﬁnite ﬁeld size is large enough. This gives the following
lemma.

Suppose that node 1 fails in stage t, and we want to repair
node 1 by the ﬁrst packets Γt (2, 1), Γt (3, 1), Γt (4, 1) and
Γt (5, 1) in node 2 to node 5 respectively. In order to maintain
the (n, 2) recovery property in stage t + 1, we need to
guarantee that after the repair, each of the ﬁve sets of global
encoding vectors, Γt+1 (C1,2 ), Γt+1 (C1,3 ), Γt+1 (C1,4 ), and
Γt+1 (C1,5 ) are linearly independent.

3

It is well-known that under the condition q + 1 ≥ n(n − 2),
we can construct n(n−2) vectors of length B with components
drawn from Fq , such that every subset of B vectors are linearly
independent over Fq [8]. (These vectors form a generating matrix of a maximal-distance separable (MDS) code of dimension
B over Fq .) In stage 0, we take these n(n − 2) vectors as the
initial global encoding vectors. Since any set of B of them
are linear independent by construction, the global encoding
vectors in any two storage nodes are linear independent. Thus
the (n, 2) recover property holds in the initial stage.
We will display a choice function by a sequence of n ×
(n − 2) arrays. For each t ≥ 0, we create an n × (n − 2) array
and write “i” in the r-th row and the χ(t, i, r)-th column. The
array associated with stage t is interpreted as follows. If node
i fails in stage t, for r ̸= i, node r sends the j-th packet to
node i if the j-th column in the array in stage t is labeled
by i.
An example for n = 5 is shown in Fig. 2. In stage 0,
we initialize χ(0, i, j) = 1 for all i and j, i.e., no matter
which node fails, the surviving nodes send their ﬁrst packets
to the newcomer. In the r-th row, we write the element in
{1, 2, . . . , 5} \ {r} in the column labeled by “Packet 1”.
Suppose that node 1 fails in stage 0, i.e., ℓ0 = 1. The newcomer receives packets with global encoding vector Γ0 (2, 1),
Γ0 (3, 1), Γ0 (4, 1) and Γ0 (5, 1). The indices of these four
packets are R0 (1) = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)}. The packets
in the repaired node 1 are linear combinations of these four
packets. Then, we specify the choice function for stage t = 1.
From the hypothesis that no node fails in two consecutive
stages, node 1 will not fail in stage 1. The 5×3 array associated
with stage 1 does not contain the label “1’. We design the
choice function by evenly “spreading” the labels 2 to 5 in the
array. In rows 2 to 5, each entry in the array contains exactly
one label. Each packet is potentially used in the repair process
after stage 1, depending on which node fails in stage 1. This
“evenly spread” property is expressed mathematically as
Property (a): For j ̸= ℓt−1 , χ(t, i, j) = χ(t, i′ , j) only if
i = i′ .
From the discussion at the beginning of this section, we try
to avoid using the same packet in the repair process of two
consecutive stages. This motivates the second heuristics in the
design of the choice function. Since the ﬁrst packets in nodes
2 to 5 have been used in the repair process before stage 1, we
want to impose the requirement that at most one of these four
packets are used again in the repair process after stage 1. As
there are four possible node failures in stage 1, this implies
that exactly one of these four packets is used in the repair of
the node failure in stage 1. Indeed, the choice function at stage
1 satisﬁes this requirement. The four entries under “Packet 1”,
corresponding to nodes 2 to 5, are distinct.
Suppose node 2 fails in stage 1. Node 1 and 5 send
the ﬁrst packets in their memory to the newcomer, while
nodes 3 and 4 send the last packets in their memory to the
newcomer. The indices of these four packets are R1 (2) =
{(1, 1), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 1)}. We note that only the ﬁrst packet
in node 5 is used twice in the repair after stage 0 and stage 1. In

Lemma 1. Suppose that node ℓt fails in stage t, and the
choice function χ is given. If for each j ̸= ℓt , the set of
vectors in Γt (St (ℓt , j)) are linearly independent, then we can
(t)
choose Hℓt such that the vectors in Γt+1 (Cℓt ,j ) are linearly
independent for all j ̸= ℓt , provided that the underlying ﬁnite
ﬁeld is sufﬁciently large.
The intuition from Lemma 1 is as follows. The (n, 2) recovery property per se requires that the global encoding vectors in
any two storage nodes are linearly independent. However, in
order to sustain the (n, 2) recovery property through repair-bytransfer, we need to ensure the linear independence of many
other sets of global encoding vectors. The next lemma serves
as a tool for this purpose. Recall that for a set X of indices,
the notation Γt (X ) stands for the set of global encoding vector
corresponding to the indices in X in stage t.
Lemma 2. Suppose that node ℓt fails in stage t, and packets
with indices Rt (ℓt ) are used to repaired node ℓt . Let X and Y
be two sets of indices of global encoding vectors in stage t and
t + 1 respectively, such that Y \ X ⊆ Cℓt and X \ Y ⊆ Rt (ℓt ).
If the set of vectors in Γt (X ) are linearly independent, then
we can choose the local encoding matrix in stage t such that
the vectors in Γt+1 (Y) are linearly independent.
The proof of Lemma 2 is omitted.
IV. M AIN T HEOREM
The choice function χ has to be carefully chosen, otherwise the (n, 2) recovery property cannot be preserved for
unbounded number of stages. As a counter-example, suppose
that in Example 1 we always pick the ﬁrst packets in the
memory of the surviving nodes in the repair process, i.e., the
function χ(t, ℓt , j) is identically equal to 1 in all stages. Then
the dimension of the span of totality of encoding vectors in all
nodes will eventually drop to four or less. As the dimension
of the original data ﬁle is six, the data recovery will doom to
failure.
The main theorem in this paper is that there is an appropriate
choice function which preserve the (n, 2) recovery property
through repair-by-transfer.
Theorem 3. For all n ≥ 4, there exists an (n, n − 1, 2)
MDS repair-by-transfer regenerating code for functional repair, meeting the lower bound on repair-bandwidth in (1).
Moreover, the ﬁnite ﬁeld size can be chosen to be any prime
(
)
power larger than n(n−2) .
2(n−2)
We will only sketch the proof of Theorem 3 in this section,
and go through an example for illustration. The idea of proof is
to come up with a choice function χ(t, i, j) and local encoding
(t)
matrix Hi , such that there are sufﬁciently many sets of
linearly independent global encoding vectors in every stage.
We let B = k(d+1−k) = 2(n−2), α = n−2 and β = 1, by
normalizing the unit if necessary. In the proof of Theorem 3,
we assume that no node will fail in two consecutive stages,
because, say if node i fails in stage t and t + 1, we can repeat
the repair procedure taken in stage t.

in stage 2 satisﬁes Property (a), i.e., for r ∈ {1, 3, 4, 5}, each
entry in row r contains exactly one label. Also, the label “2”
does not appear, because it is assumed that node 2 will not
fail in stage 2. We can check that

We give an existence proof of a family of MDS regenerating
codes with the property that failed node is repaired by transferring packets received in earlier time. This can be regarded as
a linear code with coefﬁcients restricted to {0, 1}. In a recent
work by Wang et al. in [9], a construction of MDS exactrepair regenerating code with optimal disk I/O cost for any
k is given. Their construction differs from the construction in
this paper as being a vector linear regenerating code; the data
sent from a surviving node to the newcomer is divided into
many fragments, and each fragment is a linear combination of
the source data (β > 1). The regenerating code considered in
this paper is scalar linear regenerating codes (β = 1). Another
vector linear regenerating code for repairing the systematic
nodes only can be found in [10].

R1 (2) ∩ R2 (1) = {(3, 3)},
R1 (2) ∩ R2 (3) = {(1, 1)},
R1 (2) ∩ R2 (4) = {(5, 1)},
R1 (2) ∩ R2 (5) = {(4, 3)}.
We formulate this heuristic as follows.

We write X −→ Y if Y and X satisfy the condition in
Lemma 2. Under the choice function as in Fig. 2, and ℓ0 = 1,

The asterisks in each array indicate a set of six global
encoding vectors. In stage 2, it is required that the global
encoding vectors in nodes 1 and 2 are linearly independent.
By Lemma 1, this can be guaranteed if the global encoding
vectors
S1 (2, 1) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 1)},
in stage 1 are linearly independent, and this in turns can be
done as in Lemma 2 if the global encoding vectors with indices
{(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1)}
in stage 0 are linearly independent. We initialize the global
encoding vectors in stage 0 in such a way that any six global
encoding vectors are linearly independent. Hence, in stage 2,
with suitable choice of local encoding matrices, the six global
encoding vectors in nodes 1 and 2 are linearly independent.
The main idea of proof is that the above example can
be generalized to all Ci,j in all stages, provided that the
choice function satisﬁes Properties (a) and (b), and some other
technical conditions. The details of the proof is omitted due
to space limitation.
