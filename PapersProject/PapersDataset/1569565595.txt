Abstract—In this paper, for an integer k, we evaluate an upper
bound for the cross-correlation of a ternary m-sequence of period
N = 34k+2 − 1 and its decimated sequence with decimation
4k+2
−32k+1 +2
d= 3
+ 32k+1 . It is found that the cross-correlation
4
is upper bounded by 4.5 · 32k+1 + 1.
Index Terms—cross-correlation, decimation, exponential sum,
m-sequence, quadratic form

of them have the lowest rank.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present preliminaries and notations. In Section
III, we investigate the upper bound for the cross-correlation
magnitude. Some discussion and a conjecture on the crosscorrelation value is proposed in Section IV. Finally, concluding
remarks are given in Section V.

I. I NTRODUCTION

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Trace Functions and Cross-Correlation Functions
Let p be a prime and n be an integer. Let Fpn be the ﬁnite
ﬁeld with pn elements. The trace function trn : Fpn → Fp is
1
deﬁned as

The cross-correlation between p-ary m-sequences and their
decimated sequences by d has been extensively studied by
many researchers. Trachtenberg [1] investigated the crossk
+2
correlation for the decimation d = p 2 and d = p2k − pk + 1
when p is an odd prime. Helleseth [2] summarized many
known results and evaluated cross-correlation distributions for
various values of decimations. Muller [3] proved that for odd
n, the cross-correlation between a teranry m-sequence and its
√
n
n
+1
−1
decimation by d = 33+1 + 3 2 is upper bounded by 2 pn .
Hu et al. [4] generalized Muller’s result to p = 3 mod 4,
and Xia, Zeng, and Hu [5] have evaluated the correlation
distribution. More recently, Ness and Helleseth, Kholosha
[6] derived the distribution of the cross-correlation values
k
+1
for p = 3, d = 3 2 , where k is an odd integer with
gcd(k, n) = 1. For an odd prime p, even n, and d = pk + 1
with gcd(n, k) = 1, Seo, Kim, No, and Shin [7] estimated
√
the upper bound 1 + p pn . Choi, Lim, No, and Chung [8]
investigated cross-correlation values for an odd prime p and
m
2
decimation d = (p +1) , where m is odd. For a more detailed
2(p+1)
overview on this subject, we refer the reader to [9].
In this paper, for an integer k, we derived an upper bound
for the cross-correlation of a ternary m-sequence of period
4k+2
−32k+1 +2
34k+2 −1 and its decimation with d = 3
+32k+1 .

It is shown that the upper bound is given as 4.5·32k+1 +1. For
the derivation, we use the quadratic form theory as in [3]-[8],
but in this case four quadratic forms are involved. To obtain
possible rank combinations of quadratic forms, Bluher’s result
[10], [11] is employed. It is shown that quadratic forms have
only even ranks and among four quadratic forms, at most one

where aij ∈ Fp . The matrix A = (aij ) is called a coefﬁcient
matrix of f , and det(f ) = ∆ is deﬁned to be det(A). If the
rank of A is k for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n, then we say that the rank
of f is also k. If rank(f ) = n, f is said to be nondegenerate.
For a nondegenerate quadratic form f over Fp , one can
calculate the number of solutions of f (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) = b for
b ∈ Fp by the following lemma.

Lemma 1: [12] Let η be the quadratic character of Fp . The
number of solutions N (b) of f (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) = b in Fn , when

Thus the set of roots of a linearized polynomial is a vector

1) f has at least three roots in F ;

For the case of rank(f ) = k < n, we can obtain the
number of solutions by multiplying the result of Lemma 1 or

By the previous lemma, we have the following relation

Lemma 7: The number of roots of the linearized polynomial fi (z), i = 0, 1, 2 or 3, is one of 1, 9, and 81.

1, 9, and 81. Note that the linearized polynomial fi (z) has
the degree 3n−1 , which is not constant, but depends on n.

80. Adding a zero root (z = 0), we have 1, 9, 17, and 81.
Since the original equation is a linearized polynomial, 17
cannot be a number of root. Thus the linearized polynomial
can have only 1, 9, and 81 roots.

(n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 2), (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4).
For each of these rank combinations, we can derive the upper
bound of the cross-correlation values using Lemma 2. We will
check only for the last case, (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4). Using

write ci = β 2k+1 = (α4l )2k+1 = α8lk+4l . Note that l is odd
since m is odd. Applying Corollary 6 again, we have (3), but

upper bounded by 4.5 · 3m + 1. It is easily checked that among
all the rank combinations above, (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4)

Therefore, l is odd. Thus y ∈ C2 . From (2), we have
ai ∈ C2 . This implies that ci is in C2 , which contradicts
i = 1 or i = 3. Therefore if fi (z) has 81 roots, then i = 0.

Note that the cross-correlation is 7-valued. The similar result
is obtained for n = 10. Based on these, we propose the
following conjecture on the cross-correlation distribution.

It is well known that the number of roots of the linearized
polynomial fi (z) is equal to 3n−rank(gi (y)) . Therefore by what
we have dicussed so far, each gi (y) has a rank of n, n − 2, or
n − 4, and only one of gi (y) can have the rank n − 4 for i =
0, 1, 2, 3. Thus we can enumrate 9 possible rank combinations
of gi (y), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ignoring order as

The main difﬁculty of the problem originates from two
factors. First, since there are more than two quadratic forms
involved, we have to exclude more candidate values for the
cross-correlation. In computer search, we found that every
rank combination in (5) actually appear. Thus we have to rule
out some combinations of i values, so that some exponential
sums in (6) cancel out each other. One typical technique to
do this is to set gi (y) = rgj (y) for some nonsquare r so that
det(gi ) = rk det(gj ), where k is a rank of gi and gj . If k is
odd, we can conclude that i = − j as we wish to show. But
in our case, all ranks of quadratic forms are even. This is the
second factor which makes the problem difﬁcult.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the upper bound for the
crosscorrelation function between a ternary m-sequence of
period n = 4k + 2 and its decimated sequence with the
4k+2
−32k+1 +2
+ 32k+1 . It is shown that the
decimation d = 3
4
cross-correlation is upper bounded by 4.5 · 3n/2 + 1. For the
derivation, it is proved that 1, 9, 81 are only possible number
of solutions of linearized polynomials and only one among
four linearized polynomials can have 81 roots. A conjecture
on the exact cross-correlation value is proposed as an open
problem.
