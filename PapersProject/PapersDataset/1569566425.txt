Abstract— In this paper, we develop several lower bounds on
the capacity of binary input symmetric q-ary output channels
with synchronization errors, e.g., substitution/erasure channels
with synchronization errors. More precisely, we show that if a
channel with synchronization errors can be decomposed into a
cascade of two independent channels where only the ﬁrst one
suffers from synchronization errors, a lower bound on its capacity
related to the capacity of the one with only synchronization
errors can be given. We present several examples with the
new approach and demonstrate that for certain channels, e.g.,
deletion/substitution channel, it is possible to derive tighter
capacity lower bounds than the existing ones.

rate for the concatenated channel in terms of the capacity of the
ﬁrst channel (the synchronization error only channel) and the
parameters of the second channel (the memoryless channel).
We then apply the resulting bound to several models of
interest. For instance, we consider Gallager’s deletion channel
concatenated with a binary symmetric channel, and utilize the
tightest available bounds on the deletion-only channel capacity to derive an achievable rate for the deletion-substitution
channel. For certain sets of parameters, the new bounds turn
out to be tighter than the existing ones. The result is general,
and other models for synchronization error channels can also
be employed, e.g., Gallager insertion/deletion model [4] or
models adopted in [2, 5, 6].
There are several papers deriving upper and/or lower bounds
on the capacity of the ins/del channels, e.g., [4, 7–12]; however, there are only a few results on upper and/or lower bounds
on the capacity of the ins/del channels with substitution errors,
e.g., [4, 13, 14]. Hence, our results here will provide a tool to
derive additional results that will help in understanding of the
ins/del channels where the effects of noise are also taken into
account.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give the
general model for a binary input symmetric q-ary output channel with synchronization errors and present several lemmas
that will be used in the proofs of the main results. Achievable
rates over several speciﬁc channel models are presented in
Section III, where we ﬁrst focus on sub/ers channels with
synchronization errors (sub/ers/synch channels) and binary
input symmetric quaternary output channels, then give our
results for arbitrary values of q. We present several numerical
examples and compare our results with the existing ones in
Section IV. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section V.

I. INTRODUCTION
Synchronization errors represent some of the most important impairments encountered in various digital communication systems, for instance, in bit patterned media recording
systems [1] or in other communication systems where the
transmitter and receiver clocks are not perfectly synchronized.
Different models that can capture the effects of the synchronization errors exist, such as a deletion channel where
transmitted bits get deleted randomly with no knowledge of the
deleted bit positions at the transmitter or at the receiver. Other
models include insertion channels, insertion/deletion channels,
etc. It is also of interest to incorporate the effects of the
additive noise present at the receiver leading to more complicated models, such as insertion/deletion/substitution channels,
or synchronization error channels taking into account additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) [2].
In this paper, we consider memoryless binary input symmetric q-ary output channels with synchronization errors.
Dobrushin in [3] proved that Shannon’s theorem applies for
general memoryless channels with synchronization errors in
which every transmitted symbol is independently replaced with
a random number of symbols (including the empty string in
the case of a deletion event), and the transmitter and receiver
have no information about the positions of the synchronization
errors. Speciﬁcally, we consider the concatenation of two
independent channels where the ﬁrst one is a binary channel
with only synchronization errors and the second one is a memoryless binary input symmetric q-ary output channel (BSQC).
As a particular example, the ﬁrst channel can be a binary
insertion/deletion (ins/del) channel and the second one can be
a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a substitution/erasure
(sub/ers) channel (a ternary output channel q = 3 described
precisely in Section II). We compute an achievable information

II. PRELIMINARIES
A. Channel Model
By channels with synchronization errors we refer to the
general model employed by Dobrushin in [3] where memoryless channels with synchronization errors are described by
a channel matrix allowing for the channel outputs to be of
different lengths for different uses of the channel. Neither the
transmitter nor the receiver have any information about the
position or pattern of the synchronization errors. By a binary
input symmetric q-ary output channel with synchronization
errors, we refer to a channel which can be considered as a
concatenation of two independent channels where the ﬁrst
one is a channel with only synchronization errors with the

Proposition 1. Let X, Y and Y (q) form a Markov chain,

any possible joint distribution of X, Y and Y (q) , where A

input sequence X and the output sequence Y , and the second
one is a BSQC with the input sequence Y and the output
sequence Y (q) . By a symmetric channel, we refer to the
deﬁnition given in [15, p. 94], i.e., a channel is symmetric
if by dividing the columns of the transition matrix into submatrices, in each sub-matrix, each row can be written as
a permutation of any other row and each column can be
written as a permutation of any other column. For example,
a channel with independent substitution, erasure and synchronization errors (sub/ers/synch channel) can be considered
as a concatenation of a channel with only synchronization
errors and a symmetric substitution/erasure channel (a binary
input ternary output channel) with the output sequence Y (3)
depicted in Fig. 1. a. Similarly a binary input symmetric
quaternary output channel with synchronization errors can be
decomposed into two independent channels such that the ﬁrst
one is a memoryless synchronization error channel and the
second one is a memoryless binary input symmetric quaternary
output channel shown in Fig. 1. b.

Since by knowing Y (q) , random variable M is also known,
i.e., H(M |Y (q) ) = 0, we obtain H(Y (q) ) = H(Y (q) |M ) +
H(M ). By using the same approach for H(Y ), we obtain

any lower bound on Cid from the literature which potentially

Before giving the proof of Theorem 1, we consider several
special cases of the result. Since we have considered a
general synchronization error channel model (as deﬁned by
Dobrushin [3]), the derived lower bound, holds for different
models on channels with synchronization errors. A popular
model for channels with synchronization errors is the Gallager
ins/del model1 in which every bit is independently deleted
with probability pd or replaced with two random bits with
probability pi or received correctly with probability 1−pd −pi .
If we employ the Gallager model in deriving the lower bounds,
we obtain r = 1 − pd + pi , and by employing it in (11), we
obtain the following two corollaries.

Note that in deriving the inequality in (4), the summation is
taken over the values of y with p(y) = 0. However, in (14)
the summation is taken over all possible values of y of length
m (over all m-tuples), i.e., p(y) = 0 or p(y) = 0, which
results in the upper bound in (14). Furthermore, by using the
fact that the probability of having j1 erasures in a sequence
m
of length m is equal to j1 pj1 (1 − pe )m−j1 , we obtain

IV. N UMERICAL E XAMPLES
In this section, we give several numerical examples of the
lower bounds on the capacity of the ins/del/sub channel and
compare them with the existing ones in the literature.
In Table III, we compare the lower bound (12) on the
capacity of the ins/del/sub channel with the existing lower
bounds in [4, 13]. We employ the lower bound derived in [9]
as the lower bound on the capacity of the deletion-only channel
and the lower bound in [13] as the lower bound on the capacity
of the ins/del channel in (12). Note that the Gallager’s model
in [4] by parameters pd , pi and pf can be considered as
concatenation of an ins/del channel with parameters pd and pi ,
and a BSC channel with cross over probability of ps where ps
is the solution of pc = (1 − ps )(1 − pd − pi ). The advantage
of the new lower bound (12) is in using the tightest lower
bound on the capacity of the synchronization error channel
in lower bounding the capacity of the overall channel, i.e.,
the information rate of the overall channel is lower bounded
for the input distribution which results in the tightest lower
bound on the capacity of the synchronization error channel.
We observe that for pi = 0, a ﬁxed pd and small values of ps ,
the lower bound (12) improves the one given in [13]. We also
observe that the new lower bound (12) outperforms the lower
bound given in [4], but for the case pi = 0 does not improve
the lower bound given in [13], since as the lower bound on
the capacity of ins/del channel we employ the result in [13]
in the ﬁrst place.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
We presented several lower bounds on the capacity of
memoryless binary input symmetric q-ary output channels
with synchronization errors. We showed that the capacity
of any channel with synchronization errors which can be
considered as a cascade of two channels (where only the ﬁrst
one suffers from synchronization errors and the second one is
a memoryless channel) can be lower bounded in terms of the
capacity of the ﬁrst channel and the parameters of the second
channel. In particular, we considered binary input symmetric
ternary output (sub/ers) and quaternary output channels with
synchronization errors and generalized the results to the case
of a binary input symmetric q-ary output channels.
