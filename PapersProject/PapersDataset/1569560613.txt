RV W is Gaussian, the equivalence between the generalized
Stein and de Bruijn identities is proved. In particular, when
RV Y is Gaussian, not only Stein and de Bruijn identities are
equivalent, but also they are equivalent to the heat equation
identity [5].
The second major goal of this paper is to generalize de
Bruijn identity in two distinctive ways. Considering the ﬁxed
noise distribution channel model (1), the ﬁrst-order derivative
of differential entropy of output signal Y will be expressed as
a function of the posterior mean EX|Y [·|·], while the secondorder derivative of differential entropy of output signal Y
will be represented explicitly in terms of Fisher information.
Even though some of these relationships do not include
Fisher information, they still show fundamental relationships
among basic concepts in information theory and statistical
estimation theory, and these relationships hold for arbitrary
noise channels.
Several applications are brieﬂy mentioned to illustrate the
usefulness of the proposed new results. Costa’s entropy power
inequality (EPI) is derived in a simpler and alternative way.

lower bound (BCRLB) [7], and a new lower bound- tighter
than the BCRLB- for the mean square error (MSE) in Bayesian
estimation can be further derived by exploiting the proposed
results. Even though some of the proposed applications have
already been proved before, herein paper a series of novel relationships and perspectives are presented on these applications.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Preliminary
results and relationships between Stein and de Bruijn identities
are provided in Section II. Two distinctive extensions of de
Bruijn identity are presented in Section III. In Section IV,
several potential applications of the aforementioned results are
brieﬂy mentioned due to lack of space. Finally, conclusions are
stated in Section V.

Abstract—This paper illustrates the equivalence between two
fundamental results: Stein identity, originally proposed in the
statistical estimation realm, and de Bruijn identity, considered
for the ﬁrst time in the information theory ﬁeld. Two distinctive
extensions of de Bruijn identity are presented as well. For
arbitrary but ﬁxed input and noise distributions, the ﬁrst-order
derivative of differential entropy is expressed by means of a
function of the posterior mean, while the second-order derivative
of differential entropy is manifested in terms of a function of
Fisher information. Several applications exemplify the utility of
the proposed results.

I. I NTRODUCTION
De Bruijn identity, which shows a link between differential
entropy and Fisher information, was ﬁrst mentioned and
exploited by Stam in the context of building the ﬁrst rigorous
proof of the entropy power inequality (EPI), a fundamental
result exploited by Shannon to prove a lower bound on the
capacity of additive Gaussian noise channels. Recently, a
renewed interest was manifested in the applications of de
Bruijn identity in estimation and turbo (iterative) decoding
schemes, and in relating the input-output mutual information
with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) of additive
Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise channels [1], [2].
A large number of approaches have been applied to prove de
Bruijn identity. Amongst them, herein paper, we consider the
most direct approach because it shares one common technique,
viz. integration by parts, with another well-known resultreferred to as Stein identity [3], [4]. Stein identity points
out a relationship between the expectations of a function
(whose variable is a Gaussian random variable (RV)) and
its ﬁrst-order derivative, and has been also widely researched
with tremendous success in many applications from diverse
ﬁelds such as statistics, economics, probability theory, decision
theory, and graph theory (see e.g., [5]).
The main theme of this paper is to investigate how de
Bruijn identity is connected to Stein identity. To compare these
identities, the following additive noise channel is considered
throughout the paper:
√
(1)
Y = X + aW,

II. R ELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN S TEIN I DENTITY AND DE
B RUIJN I DENTITY
To interconnect Stein identity and de Bruijn identity, ﬁrst
we will introduce three fundamental results.
Theorem 1 (De Bruijn’s Identity [8], [9]): Given the channel model (1), let X be an arbitrary RV with a ﬁnite secondorder moment, and W be a Gaussian RV with zero mean and
unit variance. Independence between RVs X and W is also

where a denotes a nonnegative deterministic parameter, and
RVs X and W are assumed arbitrary and independent. When

assumed. Then,

Proof: Like the proof of Theorem 3 in [5], the equivalence
is proved by showing that de Bruijn identity is derived from
Stein identity, and vice versa. Before illustrating the details of
the proof, Lemma 1 will be exploited.
Lemma 1: For RVs X and Y deﬁned in (1), the following
relations hold:

h(Y ) =
J(Y ),

where h(·) stands for differential entropy, J(Y ) =
EY [SY (Y )2 ], EY[·] is the expectation with respect to Y , SY (Y )
is deﬁned as d log fY (y; a)/dy, and log denotes the natural
logarithm.
Proof: See [9].
Theorem 2 (Generalized Stein Identity [10]): Let Y be an
absolutely continuous RV. If the probability density function

Proof: See [5].
Since Stein identity (3) is valid only for Gaussian RVs, we
have to consider either a special case of de Bruijn identity in
Theorem 1 or use a generalized version of Stein identity (2) to
compare it with de Bruijn identity. Therefore, given (1) with
W a Gaussian RV, the equivalence between Stein identity and
de Bruijn identity is next established.
Theorem 4: Given the channel (1), let X be an arbitrary
RV with a ﬁnite second-order moment, and W be a Gaussian
RV with zero mean and unit variance. Independence between
RVs X and W is also assumed. If r(y; a) is deﬁned as

in (2), de Bruijn identity is equivalent to the generalized
Stein identity. In particular, if X is also a Gaussian RV, and
g(y; a) = − log fY (y; a) in (4), then de Bruijn, Stein, and heat
equation identities are all equivalent to one another.

The main ingredient for establishing de Bruijn identity is
that Gaussian density functions satisfy the heat equation. However, general pdfs do not satisfy the heat equation. Therefore,
to extend de Bruijn identity to additive non-Gaussian noise
channels, a general relationship between differentials of a pdf

represents the key ingredient in establishing a connection

Proof: This theorem is proved using (10), integration

Theorem 6, the details of the proof are delegated to [11].
For additive non-Gaussian noise channels, differential entropy appears not to be expressible in terms of Fisher information. Instead, differential entropy is expressed by a function
of the posterior mean as shown in Theorem 5. Fortunately,
several noise distributions of interest in communication problems satisfy the required assumptions in Theorem 5 (e.g.,
Gaussian, gamma, exponential, chi-square with restrictions
on parameters, Rayleigh, etc). Therefore, Theorem 5 is quite

powerful. In particular, if the posterior mean EX|Y [X|Y ] is
expressed by a polynomial function of Y , e.g., X and W
are independent Gaussian RVs in (1) or RVs belonging to the
natural exponential family of distribution [12], then (11) can
be expressed in simpler forms. We would like also to mention
that a result similar in nature to Theorem 5 was reported before
in [2] using a different approach. Similarly to [2], a series of
specialized applications of Theorem 5 could be envisaged.
Now, we consider the second-order derivative of differential
entropy. One interesting property of the second-order derivative of differential entropy is that it can always be expressed
as a function of Fisher information.

IV. A PPLICATIONS
A. Applications in Information Theory
In information theory, entropy power inequality (EPI) is
one of the most important inequalities since it helps to assess
channel capacity results under different circumstances, e.g.,
the capacity of Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel and the
secrecy capacity of Gaussian wire-tap channel. Therefore,
various versions of EPI such as Costa’s EPI [13] and the
extremal entropy inequality [14] were proposed by different
authors. Herein section, we will prove Costa’s EPI, a stronger
version of a classical EPI, using Theorems 1, 4, and 6.
Lemma 2 (Costa’s EPI [13]): For an arbitrary but ﬁxed RV
X with a ﬁnite second-order moment, and a Gaussian RV W
with zero mean and unit variance,

where Ja (Y ) = EY [SYa (Y )2 ], and SYa = d log fY (y; a)/da.

by Theorem 1 (de Bruijn identity), and N (Y ) ≥ 0, proving
(16) is equivalent to proving the following inequality:

details see [11]). A new lower bound, tighter than BCRLB,
for the mean square error for a Bayesian estimator can be
also derived based on Theorems 1 and 6 [11]. Second, since
Theorem 5 is equivalent to Theorem 1 in [2], Theorem 5
can be used for applications such as generalized EXIT charts
and power allocation in systems with parallel non-Gaussian
noise channels as mentioned in [2]. Finally, by Theorem 4,
we showed the equivalence among Stein, de Bruijn, and heat
equation identities. Therefore, a broad range of problems (in
probability, decision theory, Bayesian statistics, economics and
graph theory [5] that were traditionally established/analyzed
via Stein identity) could be analyzed via de Bruijn identity (in
the light of Theorems 4, 5 and 6).

Since J(Y ) converges to J(X) as a approaches zero, l(0) = 0,
and the following inequality holds for an arbitrary but ﬁxed
random variable X and arbitrary small non-negative realvalued ϵ:

J(X)
+ J(X + ϵW ) ≤ 0.

l(ϵ) − l(0) = −

This paper mainly revealed three important informationestimation theoretic results. First, we proved that Stein identity
is equivalent to de Bruijn identity. Second, the ﬁrst-order and
second-order derivatives of differential entropy with respect
to the parameter a were expressed in terms of the posterior
mean and Fisher information, respectively. Finally, several
applications of the aforementioned results were provided.
The proposed applications illustrate that the newly developed
results are useful not only in information theory but also in
the estimation theory ﬁeld and other ﬁelds.

Therefore,

Since the inequality in (20) holds for an arbitrary random

whose variance is identical to the variance of W , and X, W ,
and W are independent of one another. Then, the inequality

B. Applications in Other Areas
Due to space limitations, we only detailed Costa’s EPI
as an application of the proposed results. However, the proposed results can be further exploited in a variety of other
applications information theory, statistical signal processing,
and wireless communications. First, both CRLB and BCRLB
can be derived based on Theorems 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 (for
