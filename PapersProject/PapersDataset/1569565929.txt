We begin with extending the DMT based lower bounds for
inverse determinant sums from [1] to the case where the code
lattice is not full rank. We then introduce lattices in Lie groups
and review some recent results from [7] on the asymptotic
growth of the cardinality of the intersection of these lattices
with a sphere, which is shown to depend only on the volume
of the sphere. Then we consider Q(i)-central division algebras
and prove how the corresponding inverse determinant sums
can be analyzed by realizing part of the unit group of the
division algebra as a lattice subgroup in the Lie group SLn (C).
In the last section we give a similar treatment to space-time
codes from Q-central division algebras. Here we will also
see how the growth of the inverse determinant of a Q-central
division algebra depends on the Hasse-invariant at the inﬁnite
place. As an example of the tightness of the connections
between algebra and information theory we will derive a lower
bound for the volume of the sphere inside SLn (H), where H
is the Hamiltonian quaternion algebra.

Abstract—Earlier it was proven by Vehkalahti and Lu how
the unit group and diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT)
of division algebra-based space-time codes are linked to each
other through inverse determinant sums. This work explores this
relation further, showing that indeed the density of unit group
completely determines the growth of the inverse determinant
sum. In particular, in the case of Q(i)-central division algebras,
the lower bound obtained from the DMT and the upper bound
derived from the growth rate of units coincide.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) introduced
by Zheng and Tse [2] is now widely recognized as a fundamental parameter to evaluate the performance of space-time
codes for multi-antenna and multi-user wireless systems. For
certain algebraic code constructions, DMT-optimality has been
shown to be linked to algebraic criteria, such as the nonvanishing determinant property in the case of codes based on
central division algebras over Q(i). It is natural to ask whether
a more general framework to compare the DMT of different
types of algebraic space-time code constructions could be
established.
In [1], Vehkalahti and Lu investigated the relation between
DMT, inverse determinant sums and unit groups. On one hand,
they showed how the DMT can be used to lower bound the
growth of inverse determinant sums; on the other hand, the
authors proved that in the case of division algebra based
codes, it is possible to upper bound the asymptotic growth
of inverse determinant sums by analyzing the unit group of
the corresponding order in the algebra. In this paper we are
continuing this study and proving that the growth of the
inverse determinant sum of a division algebra is completely
determined by the growth of the unit group. This reduces
the inverse determinant sum analysis to point counting in
lattices in Lie groups. This approach does not only give us
methods to analyze division algebra codes, but it also reveals
a surprisingly tight connection between DMT and certain
asymptotic integrals in Lie groups. Most interestingly we ﬁnd
that in the case of Q(i) central division algebras the lower
bound from information theory and the point counting upper
bound coincide.

A. Diversity multiplexing gain trade-off
We consider a slow fading channel with nt transmit and
nr receive antennas, and where the decoding delay is T time
units. The channel equation can be written as
Y =

ρ
HX + N,
nt

where H ∈ Mnr ×nt (C) is the channel matrix whose entries are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean
complex circular symmetric Gaussian random variables with
variance 1, and N ∈ Mnr ×T (C) is the noise matrix whose
entries are i.i.d. zero-mean complex circular symmetric Gaussian random variables with variance 1. X ∈ Mnt ×T (C) is
the transmitted codeword, and ρ represents the signal to noise
ratio.
Deﬁnition 1.1: A space-time code C is a set of (nt × T )
complex matrices. We often use the abbreviation STBC for
space-time block code.
Let us suppose we have a coding scheme, where for each
value of ρ we have a code C(ρ) having |C(ρ)| matrices
in Mnt ×T (C). The rate R(ρ) for the code C(ρ) is then
log (|C(ρ)|)/T in bits per channel use, where the logarithm is
taken in base 2. Assuming that the scheme fulﬁlls the average

In this section we will show how the we can use the DMT
to prove lower bounds for the asymptotic growth of inverse
determinant sums. At the same time we will get criteria for a
code to achieve optimal DMT for multiplexing gain r ∈ [0, 1].
Let us suppose that we have a k-dimensional lattice L ⊆
Mn (C). The ﬁnite codes with multiplexing gain r derived from
the spherical coding scheme are

X∈C(ρ)

we then have the following deﬁnition from [2].
Deﬁnition 1.2: The scheme C(ρ) is said to achieve spatial
multiplexing gain r and diversity gain d if the data rate

and the average error probability
log(Pe (ρ))
= −d.

In the following we will frequently use the ”dotted” notation, where for real valued functions f and g we write

Assume there are nr receive antennas. Then following the
union bound together with PEP based determinant inequality
[9], we get the following bound for average error probability
for the code CL (ρrn/k )

where the matrices B1 , . . . , Bk are linearly independent over
R, i.e., form a lattice basis, and k is called the rank or the
dimension of the lattice.
Deﬁnition 1.4: [17] If the minimum determinant of the
lattice L ⊆ Mn (C) is non-zero, i.e. it satisﬁes

.

Pe ≥ ρ−(n−r)(nr −r) .
It follows that

The maximum here is achieved obviously with r = 0, but in
this case we do not have growth for our matrix sum. The next
integer point is r = 1. In this case we have

In the following we will also use the notation

for integer values of r. Let us now set M = 2ρnr/k and we
then have that

we say that the code has a non-vanishing determinant (NVD).
We now consider a coding scheme based on a k-dimensional
lattice L inside Mn (C). For a given positive real number M
we deﬁne the ﬁnite code

gives us the lower bound (3). The optimal DMT given by
Zheng and Tse, on the other hand, gives us that for integer
values of r we have that

where in the above sum (and also in the rest of the paper) the
all-zero matrix is always excluded from the sum.
Proposition 2.1: Let L be a k-dimensional NVD-lattice in
Mn (C). We then have that

and similarly ≥ and ≤.

Remark 1.1: We will also use f (M ) ≥ g(M ) in the case
where g(M ) might not have a limit. By this we only mean that

g is lower bounded by some function c(M ) where c(M ) =
f (M ).

In the following we suppose that the spherical coding
scheme is used. We will skip the proof of the following result.
Corollary 2.2: Let us suppose that we have a k-dimensional
NVD lattice code L in Mn (C). If the corresponding inverse
determinant sum achieves the bound of Proposition 2.1, then
L achieves the optimal DMT for r ∈ [0, 1].
Let us now concentrate on the case where the dimension
of the lattice code corresponds to available dimensions at

r and for each ρ level. Furthermore, the sets CL (ρ) clearly
do satisfy the average energy constraint (1). Henceforth we

simply ignore the scaling factor nt of SNR in the channel
equation as it is irrelevant in DMT calculations.

relations xu = uσ(x) for all x ∈ E and un = γ ∈ (F )∗ . We
assume that D is a division algebra.
Considering D as a right vector space over E, every element

the receiving end. In this case we have k = 2nnr and the
following.
Corollary 2.3: Let us suppose that we have a 2nnr dimensional NVD lattice L, where nr ≤ n in Mn (C). We
then have that

III. L IE G ROUPS , L ATTICES AND VOLUMES OF S PHERES
In this section we will consider a Lie group G, where G
is SLn (R), SLn (C) or SLn (H), and its lattice subgroups,
that are discrete subgroups having ﬁnite covolume. In the
following we will discuss the problem of counting the number
of points of these subgroups that lie inside a sphere (with
respect to the Frobenius norm). We refer the reader to [4]
for the relevant deﬁnitions and an introduction to the subject.
Here we suppose that SLn (H) is considered as embedded in
M2n (C) by replacing each quaternion element by its common
2 × 2 matrix representation.
Each of these groups admits a Haar measure that gives us a
natural concept of volume volG . In particular we can consider
the volumes of the balls

The mapping ψ is an injective F -algebra homomorphism
that allows us to identify D with its image in Mn (C). We
refer to det(ψ(x)) = nr(x), x ∈ D are the reduced norm of
the element x.
We need a few more concepts.
Deﬁnition 3.1: A Z-order Λ in D is a subring of D, having
the same identity element as D, and such that Λ is a ﬁnitely
generated module over Z and generates D as a linear space
over Q.
Let D be an index-n F -central division algebra and Λ be a
Z order in D. The (right) Solomon zeta function [15] of the
order Λ is
1
,
ζΛ (s) =
[Λ : I]s

volG (B(M )),
where B(M ) here refers to all the matrices in G that have
Frobenius norm less than M .
Let us now concentrate on lattice subgroups that are cocompact, meaning that the factor group G/L is compact. In
the following two results we suppose that G is one of the
previously mentioned Lie groups.
Theorem 3.1 (Corollary 1.11 and Remark 1.12, [7]):
Consider a Lie group G, a discrete cocompact lattice L ⊂ G
and x ∈ G. We then have that
xL ∩ B(M )
=K
lim
M →∞ volG (B(M ))

I∈IΛ

where s > 1 and IΛ is the set of right ideals of Λ. When
s > 1 this series is converging [17]. However, we can also
consider the truncated form of this sum at the point s = 1. In
this case we have the following lemma.
We skip the proof of the following lemma.
Lemma 3.4: If D is an index n F -central division algebra
and Λ ⊆ D is a maximal Z-order,
1
≤ N log(M )K ,
[Λ : I]1

where K is some nonzero constant independent of M . The
limit approaches K uniformly for all x ∈ G.
Theorem 3.2 (Theorem 7.4, [6]): Let us suppose that G is
a Lie group. We then have that

I∈IΛ ,[Λ:I]≤M

for some constants N and K that are independent of M .
The unit group Λ∗ of an order Λ consists of elements x ∈ Λ
such that there exists an y ∈ Λ with xy = 1A .
Lemma 3.5 ([14]): The unit group Λ∗ has a subgroup

.

volG (B(M )) = M T ,
for some T .
.
In the case when G = SLn (R) we have that volG (B(M )) =
n2 −n
M
( see [5]).
Using the methods explained in [6] we can also estimate
this volume in the case G = SLn (C), obtaining the following
lemma. Due to space limitations we will skip the proof.
Lemma 3.3: If G = SLn (C), we have that

Λ1 = {x | x ∈ Λ∗ , nr (x) = 1},
and we have [Λ∗ : Λ1 ] < ∞.
IV. I NVERSE DETERMINANT SUMS AND Q(i)- CENTRAL
DIVISION ALGEBRAS

A. Division algebras, Orders, Zeta functions and Unit Groups
Let us now consider the mathematical theory that most
easily gives us high dimensional NVD lattices.
Let E/F be a cyclic ﬁeld extension of degree n with with
Galois group G(E/F ) = σ . Deﬁne a cyclic algebra

Let us now concentrate on the case where D is an index n
Q(i)-central division algebra.
Remark 4.1: The center Q(i) was chosen for simplicity. We
could have chosen any complex quadratic center.
Proposition 4.1: If Λ is a maximal Z-order in an index n
division algebra D, then ψ(Λ) is 2n2 -dimensional NVD lattice
in Mn (C), with

D = (E/Q(i), σ, γ) = E ⊕ uE ⊕ u2 E ⊕ · · · ⊕ un−1 E,

| det(ψ(x))|2n = [Λ : xΛ],

.

volG (B(M )) = M 2n

for all the nonzero elements x ∈ Λ.
As already seen, the lattice structure of ψ(Λ) allows us to
consider the sum

ψ(x)

F ≤M,x∈Λ

generated by elements in B(M )∩ψ(Λ)). According to Lemma
4.2 we can upper bound the previous with

x∈X(M )

where L is some constant independent of M .
Using the inequality between Frobenius norm and determinant, we have

According to Proposition 2.1 we have that for an index n
2
division algebra this sum must grow at least like M 2n −2n in
the dotted sense. Let us now prove that this sum will reach
this lower bound.
In the following lemma we will denote SLn (C) with G.
Note that ψ(Λ1 ) ⊆ SLn (C) and that it is a cocompact lattice
subgroup [14, Theorem 1].
Lemma 4.2: Let D be an index-n Q(i)-central division
algebra and Λ be a Z order in D. For any x = 0 ∈ Λ, we
have
|B(M ) ∩ xΛ∗ | ≤ K|ψ(Λ1 ) ∩ B(M )|

where N1 , N2 and T are constants independent of M .
Corollary 4.5: Let D be an index n Q(i)-central division
algebra and Λ be a maximal Z order in D. Then, for nr ≥ n
the lattice ψ(Λ) achieves the optimal DMT at multiplexing
gain r ∈ [0, 1].
Remark 4.3: We note here that using the DMT bound we
2
get (in a dotted sense) growth M 2n −2n for the inverse
determinant sum of an order of a Q(i)-central division algebra,
when nr ≥ n.

As | det(ψ(xai ))| ≥ 1, we can multiply each ψ(xai ) with
a constant ci such that |ci | ≤ 1 and det(ci ψ(xai ) = 1.
Clearly |ψ(xai Λ1 ) ∩ B(M )| ≤ |ci ψ(xai Λ1 ) ∩ B(M )| for all
i. According to Theorem 3.1 we then have that
|ψ(xΛ∗ ) ∩ B(M )| ≤ N1 |ψ(Λ1 ) ∩ B(M )|,
where N1 is independent of x and M . The last dotted-equality
follows now from Lemma 3.3.
Remark 4.2: We note that all our inverse determinant sum
results do work for all orders, but for simplicity we consider
maximal ones.
Proposition 4.3: Let D be an index n Q(i)-central division
algebra and Λ be a maximal Z-order in D. Then, for nr ≥ n
we have

V. I NVERSE DETERMINANT SUMS OF Q- CENTRAL
DIVISION ALGEBRAS

Let us now concentrate on the case where the center of
the division algebra is Q. In this case we have the following.
If Λ is a Z-order in a division algebra D, then ψ(Λ) is n2 dimensional NVD lattice in Mn (C), with
| det(ψ(x))|n = [Λ : xΛ],

|ψ(Λ1 ) ∩ B(M )| ≤ Sψ(Λ) (M ) ≤ K(log M )T |ψ(Λ1 ) ∩ B(M )|

for all the nonzero elements x ∈ Λ.
Deﬁnition 5.1: Let us suppose that D is an index n Qcentral division algebra. If

where T and K are constants independent of M .
Proof: From the ideal theory of orders we have that if
xΛ = yΛ, then x and y must differ by a unit. Therefore we
can write

F ≤M,x∈Λ

,

where T and K are some constants independent of M . The
ﬁnal result now follows by substituting this to Equation 4.
Corollary 4.4: Let D be an index n Q(i)-central division
algebra and Λ be a maximal Z order in D. Then, for nr ≥ n

According to Lemma 3.4 we then have that

for any element x ∈ Λ. Together with Proposition 4.1, this
implies that

for some constant K, that is independent of x and M .
Proof: We know that Λ1 has a ﬁnite index inside Λ∗ . Let
us now suppose that a1 , . . . , aj are some representatives of
the factor group Λ∗ /Λ1 . We then have that

where X(M ) is some collection of elements x ∈ Λ,
ψ(x) F ≤ M , each generating a separate (right) ideal
(and we suppose that X(M ) does include all different ideals

we say that D is ramiﬁed at the inﬁnite place.
We will refer to the isomorphism given in the previous
deﬁnition with ψ1 . The mapping ψ1 has exactly the same

4

properties as the mapping ψ gotten by left regular presentation
(in particular the results about norms and lattice structure of
ψ1 (Λ) are true).
In the following we will denote SLn (H) and SLn (R) with
G. Just as before we have that ψ1 (Λ1 ) ⊆ G and that it is a
cocompact lattice subgroup [14, Theorem 1].
The following results can be proved just like their counterparts in the previous section.
Proposition 5.1: Let D be an index n Q-central division
algebra and Λ be a maximal Z order in D. Let us denote
ψ1 (Λ) with L. Then, for nr ≥ n/2 we have

Example 5.2: Let us now consider an algebra
(Q(i)/Q, σ, 3). We can easily prove that this is a division
algebra, where inﬁnite place is not ramiﬁed. The left regular
presentation gives us an embedding to M2 (C), but Corollary
5.3 gives that the growth of the inverse determinant sum is in
the class M 2 .
Remark 5.1: These two examples underline the fact that
two division algebra codes, that have a fairly similar look,
might have totally different inverse determinant sums. This
suggest that the performance of the codes can also be dramatically different.

Corollary 5.4: Let D be an index n, 2|n, Q-central division
algebra where the inﬁnite place is ramiﬁed. Let Λ be a
maximal Z order in D and denote ψ(Λ) with L. Then, for

where N and K are constants independent of M .
Proof: The right side is just Proposition 5.2 and the left
side follows from Proposition 2.1.
Example 5.1: Let us consider an algebra (Q(i)/Q, σ, −3)
and an order Λ = Z[i] ⊗ uZ[i], we can see that Corollary 5.4
gives growth M 0 for the corresponding inverse determinant
sum. In here we also know that the unit group of Λ is ﬁnite and
therefore volSLn/2 (H) (B(M )) is constant. This is an example
where the bound of Corollary 5.4 is tight (in a dotted sense).
