the conﬁdential messages as possible. Measuring ignorance
by equivocation, a single-letter characterization of all the
achievable triples (R1 , Re , R0 ) was provided in [4], where
Re is the second receiver’s equivocation to the conﬁdential
messages. Note that the model of [4] is also a generalization of
[9], where no conﬁdentiality condition is imposed. In addition,
Merhav [12] studied a speciﬁed wiretap channel, and obtained
the capacity region, where both the legitimate receiver and
the wiretapper have access to some leaked symbols from the
source, but the channels for the wiretapper are more noisy
than the legitimate receiver, which shares a secret key with
the encoder.
It is well known that feedback does not increase the capacity
of discrete memoryless channel (DMC). However, does the
feedback increase the capacity region of the wiretap channel?
In order to solve this problem, Ahlswede and Cai studied the
general wiretap channel (the wiretap channel does not need
to be degraded) with noiseless feedback from the legitimate
receiver [1], and both the upper and lower bounds of the
secrecy capacity were provided, which were proved to be
tight. Speciﬁcally, for the degraded case, they showed that
the secrecy capacity is larger than that of Wyner’s wiretap
channel (without feedback). Furthermore, the wiretap channel
with noisy feedback was studied in [11], and the wiretap
channel with secure rate-limited feedback was studied in [2],
and both of them focused on bounds of the secrecy capacity.
The coding for channels with causal side information at
the encoder was ﬁrst investigated by Shannon [14] in 1958.
After that, in order to solve the problem of coding for a computer memory with defective cells, Kuznetsov and Tsybakov
[10] considered a channel in the presence of noncausal side
information at the transmitter. They provided some coding
techniques without determination of the capacity. The capacity

Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the model of degraded
broadcast channel with noncausal side information, conﬁdential
messages and noiseless feedback. This work is from Steinberg’s
work on the degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information, and Csisz´r and K¨ rner’s work on broadcast channel

with conﬁdential messages. In this new model, the transmitter
sends a conﬁdential message to the non-degraded receiver, and
meanwhile sends a common message to both the degraded and
non-degraded receivers. Moreover, the channel for the nondegraded receiver is controlled by channel state information (side
information), and it is available to the transmitter in a noncausal
manner (termed here noncausal side information). In addition,
we assume that there is a noiseless feedback from the output of
the channel for the non-degraded receiver to the transmitter, and
it helps them share a secret key, which enlarges the degraded
receiver’s uncertainty about the conﬁdential message.
Measuring the uncertainty by equivocation (conditional entropy), the capacity-equivocation region composed of all achievable rates-equivocation triples is determined for this new model.
Furthermore, the secrecy capacity is formulated, which provides
the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Equivocation was ﬁrst introduced into channel coding by
Wyner in his study of wiretap channel [16]. It is a kind of
degraded broadcast channels. The object is to transmit messages to the legitimate receiver, while keeping the wiretapper
as ignorant of the messages as possible. After the publication
of Wyner’s work, Csisz´r and K¨ rner [4] investigated a more
a
o
general situation: the broadcast channels with conﬁdential
messages. The model of [4] is to transmit conﬁdential messages to receiver 1 at rate R1 and common messages to both
receivers at rate R0 , while keeping receiver 2 as ignorant of

R(A) composed of all achievable (R0 , R1 , Re ) triples is characterized in Theorem 1, where the achievable (R0 , R1 , Re )
triple is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6.
Deﬁnition 1: (Channel encoder) The conﬁdential message
S takes values in S, and the common message T takes values
in T . S and T are independent and uniformly distributed over
their ranges. V N is the side information of channel 1, and it is
the output of a discrete memoryless source pV (v). In addition,
V N is available to the channel encoder in a noncausal manner.
Note that V N is independent with S and T . The feedback
Y i−1 (where 2 ≤ i ≤ N and Y i−1 takes values in Y i−1 ) is
the previous i − 1 time output of channel 1. At the i-th time,
the inputs of the channel encoder are S, T , Y i−1 and V N ,
while the output is Xi , i.e., the channel encoder is a mapping

was found in 1980 by Gel’fand and Pinsker [8]. Furthermore,
Costa [6] investigated a power constrained additive noise
channel, where part of the noise is known at the transmitter
as side information. This channel is also called dirty paper
channel. Recently, Mitrpant et al. [13] and Chen et al. [3]
studied combinations of Costa’s dirty paper channel [6] and
the wiretap channel, where both of them focused on achievable
regions. In order to introduce side information to the broadcast
channel, Steinberg investigated the degraded broadcast channel
with side information [15], where both causal and noncausal
side information were considered in his paper. Speciﬁcally, inner and outer bounds on capacity region were provided for the
degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information
[15], meanwhile, the capacity region of the degraded broadcast
channel with causal side information was totally determined
[15].
In this paper, we study the model of degraded broadcast
channel with noncausal side information, conﬁdential messages and noiseless feedback. The model of this paper is
from Steinberg’s work on degraded broadcast channel with
noncausal side information at the encoder, and the model
of broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages provided by
Csisz´r and K¨ rner. In this new model, S is the conﬁdential
a
o
message sent to receiver 1, and T is the common message sent
to both receiver 1 and receiver 2. The transition probability of
channel 1 (for receiver 1) depends on the side information V N ,
and V N is available to the channel encoder in a noncausal
manner. In addition, there is a noiseless feedback from the
output of channel 1 to the transmitter. The receiver 2 can
observe a degraded version of the output of channel 1 Y N
via channel 2.
In Section II, the capacity-equivocation region is determined
in Theorem 1. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity is formulated
in remark 1, which provides the best transmission rate with
perfect secrecy.
The converse part of Theorem 1 is shown in Section III.
The direct part of Theorem 1 is shown in Section IV, where
the feedback is used to generate a secret key shared by the
transmitter and receiver 1. Final conclusions are provided in
Section V.

where fi (s, t, y i−1 , v N ) = xi ∈ X , s ∈ S, t ∈ T , y i−1 ∈
Y i−1 and v N ∈ V N (note that fi is a stochastic encoder,
not deterministic). The transmission rates of the conﬁdential
message and the common message are log∥S∥ and log∥T ∥ ,

respectively.
Deﬁnition 2: (Channel 1) Channel 1 is a DMC with ﬁnite
input alphabet X × V, ﬁnite output alphabet Y, and transition
probability Q1 (y|x, v), where x ∈ X , v ∈ V, y ∈ Y.
∏N
Q1 (y N |xN , v N ) = n=1 Q1 (yn |xn , vn ). The inputs of Channel 1 are X N and V N , while the output is Y N .
Deﬁnition 3: (Channel 2) Channel 2 is a DMC with ﬁnite
input alphabet Y, ﬁnite output alphabet Z, and transition
probability Q2 (z|y), where y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z. Q2 (z N |y N ) =
∏N
N
n=1 Q2 (zn |yn ). The inputs of Channel 2 is Y , while the
N
output is Z . Receiver 2’s equivocation to the conﬁdential
message is deﬁned as
1
∆ = H(S|Z N ).

N
In this paper, we assume that receiver 2 has no knowledge
about the feedback (except his own output Z N ), and this
assumption is the same as that of [1].
Deﬁnition 4: (Decoder 1) Decoder 1 is a mapping fD1 :
Y N → S × T , with input Y N and outputs S, T . Let Pe1
be the error probability of receiver 1 , and it is deﬁned as
P r{(S, T ) ̸= (S, T )}.
Deﬁnition 5: (Decoder 2) Decoder 2 is a mapping fD2 :
Z N → T , with input Z N and output T . Let Pe2 be the error
probability of receiver 2 , and it is deﬁned as P r{T ̸= T }.
Deﬁnition 6: (Achievable (R0 , R1 , Re ) triple) A triple
(R0 , R1 , Re ) (where R0 , R1 , Re > 0) is called achievable if,
for any ϵ > 0 (where ϵ is an arbitrary small positive real
number and ϵ → 0), there exists a channel encoder-decoder
(N, ∆, Pe1 , Pe2 ) such that

and calligraphic letters, respectively. A similar convention is
applied to the random vectors and their sample values. For

uN = (u1 , ..., uN ) is a speciﬁc vector value in U N that is the
N th Cartesian power of U. UiN denotes a random N − i + 1vector (Ui , ..., UN ), and uN = (ui , ..., uN ) is a speciﬁc vector

Theorem 1 gives a single-letter characterization of the set
R(A) , which is composed of all achievable (R0 , R1 , Re )
triples, and it is proved in the remaining sections.

Theorem 1: A single-letter characterization of the region
R(A) is as follows,

IV. D IRECT PART OF T HEOREM 1
In this section we show the direct part of Theorem 1.
Suppose (R0 , R1 , Re ) ∈ RA , we will show that (R0 , R1 , Re )
is achievable, i.e., for any given ϵ > 0 (where ϵ → 0), there
exists a channel encoder-decoder (N, ∆, Pe1 , Pe2 ) satisﬁes
(2.3).
The proof of the direct part of Theorem 1 is considered into
six cases, see the following.
(i) I(K; Y |U ) − I(A; Z|U ) + I(A; V |U ) ≤ H(Y |Z) ≤
I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ),
(ii) I(K; Y |U ) − I(A; Z|U ) + I(A; V |U ) ≤ I(K; Y ) −
I(K; V ) ≤ H(Y |Z),
(iii) H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y |U ) − I(A; Z|U ) + I(A; V |U ) ≤
I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ),
(iv) H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ I(K; Y |U ) −
I(A; Z|U ) + I(A; V |U ),
(v) I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ I(K; Y |U ) − I(A; Z|U ) +
I(A; V |U ) ≤ H(Y |Z),
(vi) I(K; Y ) − I(K; V ) ≤ H(Y |Z) ≤ I(K; Y |U ) −
I(A; Z|U ) + I(A; V |U ).
For (i) and (ii), the direct part of Theorem 1 is proved
by the following subcase 1 and subcase 2. For (iii), (iv),
(v) and (vi), the direct part of Theorem 1 is proved by the
following subcase 3.
• (Subcase 1) For case (i) and case (ii), if I(K; Y |U ) +
I(U ; Z) − I(U ; V ) > I(A; Y ) − I(A; V ), an encodingdecoding scheme using feedback is introduced. Specifically, the noiseless feedback from receiver 1 to the
transmitter is used to generate a shared secret key. Part
of the conﬁdential message S is transmitted by the secret
key, and the other part of S is transmitted by using a
similar method in [4].
• (Subcase 2) For case (i) and case (ii), if I(K; Y |U ) +
I(U ; Z) − I(U ; V ) ≤ I(A; Y ) − I(A; V ), there is no
need to use feedback to generate a shared secret key, and
the proof is similar to the direct part of [4]. Note that for
subcase 1 and subcase 2, a sufﬁcient condition of the corresponding proof is to show that, the (R0 , R1 , Re ) triple
satisfying Re = I(K; Y |U ) − I(A; Z|U ) + I(A; V |U ) is
achievable.
• (Subcase 3) For case (iii), case (iv), case (v) and case
(vi), all of the conﬁdential message S is transmitted by
the secret key.
For subcase 1 and subcase 3 (using feedback), a block
Markov coding scheme is used. For subcase 2, a coding
scheme similar to that in [4] is used. Now the remaining of
this section is organized as follows. For the three subcases,
the construction of the code is introduced in Subsection IV-A,
and the equivocation analysis is given in Subsection IV-B.

(Step i) The ﬁrst part of Step (i) is about the determination
of the size of the conﬁdential message set S and the
common message set T , the second part is a realization
of the auxiliary random vector U N , see the following.

– (Determination of the size of S and T for subcase

message set T satisfy the following conditions:

are uniformly distributed over their ranges), and the
ranges of S1 and S2 satisfy:

•

– (Subcase 1) Generate a set RK composed of
2N I(K;Y )−N γ5 sequences k N , and each of them is
N
uniformly drawn from the typical set TK (ϵ∗ ). Divide
the set RK into ∥ S2 ∥ subsets, and each subset
RK,i (1 ≤ i ≤∥ S2 ∥) corresponds to a speciﬁc
value in S2 . Here note that from (4.4), we have
∥ S2 ∥≤ 2N I(K;Y |U ) ≤(a) 2N I(K;Y ) , where (a) is
from U → K → Y .
Meanwhile, generate a mapping gf : Y N → S2 (note
that 2N H(Y ) ≥∥ S2 ∥). Deﬁne a random variable
K ∗ = gf (Y N ), which is uniformly distributed over
S2 , and K ∗ is independent of S2 . Reveal the mapping gf to both receivers and the transmitter.
We use the block Markov coding method for subcase
1. The random vectors U N , K N , AN and X N
consist of n blocks of length N . The common
message for n blocks is T n
(T1 , ..., Tn ), which
is composed of n i.i.d. random variables uniformly
distributed over T . The conﬁdential message for n
blocks is S n ((S1,1 , (S1,2 , S2,2 ), ..., (S1,n , S2,n )),
where S1,i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are i.i.d. random variables
uniformly distributed over S1 , and S2,i (2 ≤ i ≤ n)
are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed over
S2 . Note that in the ﬁrst block, there is no S2,1 .
In the ﬁrst block, randomly choose a sequence k N
from the the set RK to transmit, and k N is a
realization of K N in the ﬁrst block.
In the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n), when the transmitter
receives the output y N of the i-1-th block, he com∗
putes ki = gf (y N ) ∈ S2 . For the given s2,i , the
transmitter randomly chooses a sequence k N from
∗
the subset RK,i=s2,i ⊕ki (where ⊕ is the modulo
addition over S2 ), and k N is a realization of K N
in the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n).
– (Subcase 2) Since there is no need to use feedback
in subcase 2, randomly choose a sequence k N from
N
the typical set TK (ϵ∗ ) to transmit, and k N is a
N
realization of K
– (Subcase 3) Letting S2 = S and removing S1 , the
description of K N in subcase 3 is along the lines
of that in subcase 1, and therefore, we omit the
description here.

that t ∈ T and i ∈ I = {1, ..., 2

The construction of AN in subcase 1 and 2 is similar to
the construction of X N in [4]. The random variables J,
L and M are used for indexing the random vector AN ,
and they take values in J , L and M, respectively. The
details about the construction of AN is in [7], and we
omit it here.

For a given common message t (t ∈ T ) and side
information v N , try to ﬁnd a codeword in subset
{uN (t, 1), ..., uN (t, 2N I(U ;V ) )} that is jointly typical with v N , say uN (t, i∗ ), i.e., (uN (t, i∗ ), v N ) ∈
N
TU V (ϵ∗∗∗ ). If multiple such sequences in subset
{uN (t, 1), ..., uN (t, 2N I(U ;V ) )} exist, choose the one
with the smallest i∗ . If no such i∗ exists, then declare
an encoding error.

In subcase 3, for each uN (t, i), generate a vector aN i.i.d.

The equivocation analysis is a combination of those in [1]

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the model of degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information, conﬁdential
messages and noiseless feedback. This work is from Steinberg’s work on the degraded broadcast channel with noncausal
side information, and Csisz´r and K¨ rner’s work on broadcast
a
o
channel with conﬁdential messages. The capacity-equivocation
region is totally determined, and the secrecy capacity is
formulated.
However, without the noiseless feedback link, the capacityequivocation region is still unknown, and this is our future
work.
