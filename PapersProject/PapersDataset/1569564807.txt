scheme for 2-D equalization. Marrow and Wolf [7] considered
2-D DFE and MAP-DFE hybrid equalization schemes over an
L−shaped ISI channel. Wu et al [8] developed 2-D iterative
detection and decoding scheme for a separable 2-D ISI system.
In most practical systems, 2-D ISI is generally non-separable.
Shental et al [9] developed a generalized belief propagation
approach that achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance for 2-D ISI channels. Simulations in [9] considered
(20×20) 2-D data sizes with smaller 2-D ISI masks (2×2). It is
practically difﬁcult to simulate conditions for higher ISI shapes
and sizes using the method in [9]. In a recent prior work, Chen
et al [10] developed an iterative soft-decision feedback zigzag MAP algorithm. This method demonstrated performance
close to nearly optimal detection with lower complexity and
compared well with the method presented in [9].
In this paper we are interested in iterative multi-row/column
MAP detectors for handling 2-D ISI. In section II, we derive
the general form of the multi-track MAP detector considering
the feedback information from neighboring bit cells outside
local 2-D ISI span. We use this algorithm subsequently
to develop a 2-D iterative multi-row/column turbo-detector.
Simulation results over the AWGN channel are discussed in
section III with concluding remarks in section IV. The main
contribution of this work is a set of low complexity tractable
2-D detection methods based on the turbo principle.

Abstract—We develop several novel signal detection algorithms
for two-dimensional intersymbol-interference channels. The core
in all these schemes is a modiﬁed one-dimensional maximum aposteriori (MAP) detection algorithm that operates over single
and multiple rows providing a balanced performance vs. complexity tradeoff. We explore 2-D iterative algorithms that operate
by feeding extrinsic information from multi-row/column detectors
in a turbo fashion. Multi-row/column MAP detection using 2D turbo-processing yields more than 2 dB signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) gain compared to a non-iterative multi-row detector over
the additive white Gaussian channel and within 0.1 dB of the
ML estimate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Two-dimensional (2-D) intersymbol-interference (ISI) channels have become practically relevant in various data recording technologies such as two-dimensional magnetic recording
(TDMR), optical holographic memories [1] [2] as well as in
other areas such as pixelated wireless optical channels [3] and
2-D grid networks. From a signal processing view point, data
recording systems in 2-D have advantages over traditional 1D systems. 2-D recording systems are less sensitive to timing
instabilities due to wider read sensory elements for tracking
timing drifts. With efﬁcient 2-D signal detection methods,
guard bands between 2-D coded blocks can be eliminated,
thereby, improving format efﬁciency. Thus, 2-D ISI can be
beneﬁcially combatted to realize SNR gains by clever signal
processing.
There is a wide spectrum of 1-D detection techniques
ranging from decision feedback equalization (DFE) to the
optimal MAP algorithm that can be extended to the 2-D case.
2-D DFE methods are easy to implement but suffer from error
propagation. The 1-D MAP algorithm is theoretically optimal
and is the best-in-class detector for minimizing bit-error rate.
However, unlike 1-D MAP detection [4] that can be practically
realized, 2-D MAP detection is NP-complete [5]. It is difﬁcult
to realize a 2-D trellis spanning signal dimensions greater
than just a few bits. We need low complexity 2-D signal
detection algorithms based on 1-D schemes to get close to
near optimal 2-D MAP detection performance. Several authors
have considered various approaches towards 2-D detection.
Nelson et al [6] derived a multi-dimensional decision feedback

We present 2-D non-iterative and iterative MAP based
detection algorithms in this work and compare their efﬁcacies
with single row/column and multi-row/column variations. The
trellis of the multi-row/column detector is compliant with the
span of the 2-D ISI, while the single-row/column version is
approximated by a simpliﬁed 1-D MAP trellis with much
lower complexity.

As in [4], we set

A. Derivation of the Algorithms

βi,j (s) = P {yi,a }j+1≤a≤N |Sj = s ,

We choose a generalized mask shown in part (a) of
Figure 1. The coefﬁcients [β −K1 , · · · , β−1 , 1, β1 , · · · , βK1 ]
denote
horizontal
ISI,
and
the
coefﬁcients
[α−K2 , · · · , α−1 , 1, α1 , · · · , αK2 ] denote vertical ISI. The
size of this mask is (2K2 + 1) × (2K1 + 1). The coefﬁcients
with negative indices denote the causal part; while the
positive indices denote the anti-causal part. Practical 2-D
runlength-limited ISI channels in recording systems [13]
could be represented by this ‘band-aid’ shape mask. In
practice, the span of 2-D diagonal interference over arbitrary
ISI shapes is small due to the physical constraints [11].
Though we choose an asymmetric runlength-limited shaped
mask throughout this paper for the sake of illustration, this
assumption can be readily generalized for any arbitrary 2-D
ISI shape within our framework.
As in the conventional BCJR algorithm [4], we do the scan
based on the forward-backward procedure. To compute the
received image y, we assume a boundary of −1 pixels around
x; the detector uses this boundary condition so that the MAP

(8)

γi,j (s , s) = P (Sj = s, yi,j |Sj−1 = s );
the state transition probability γ is computed at every stage
along the trellis. Using the branch metrics (γ’s), the α and β
terms are computed using the forward-backward recursion:
αi,j (s) =

αi,j−1 (s )γi,j (s , s),

(9)

βi,j (s)γi,j (s , s).

(10)

computed as

A trellis based on the 3 × 3 mask h has 5 state pixels (i.e.
s0 through s 4 and 3 input pixels as shown in Figure 3) . The 3
input pixels lead to 8 branches coming into/going out from one
state. There are 4 feedback pixels (ω 0 , ω1 , ω2 , ω3 ) which are

a-priori information for both the input pixels and the feedback
pixels come from the previous detector iteration cycle. With
no feedback, they can be assumed to be zero a-priori. With
feedback, extrinsic information from the previous detector will
be scaled and set as feedback. We will discuss this in more
detail in section II-B.

We deﬁne the non-iterative algorithm with three central rows
without any feedback pixels (with the trellis deﬁnition as in
Figure 3) as ‘algorithm A’.
We deﬁne the non-iterative algorithm with three central
rows utilizing equally likely feedback information according to
equation (19) as ‘algorithm B’. In other words, for algorithm
B, in the computation of P (y i,j | Sj = s, Sj−1 = s ), we
use the vector y i,j = [yi−1,j−1 , yi,j , yi+1,j−1 ] as opposed to
yi,j = [yi,j ] for algorithm A.
Following the above example, over a (2K 1 + 1) × (2K2 +
1) 2-D ISI span, an algorithm processing R = max(2K 1 +

the iterative 2-D algorithm taking into a-priori information

‘algorithm D’.
We deﬁne a simpliﬁed 2-D detection scheme that we term
‘algorithm E’ as follows. We deﬁne a reduced state comprising
of two adjacent pixels s 0 and s1 in the row direction as shown
in Figure 2. An input pixel which is a branch connecting
two neighboring states determines the next state. Two extra
feedback pixels (ω 0 , ω1 ) are added as shown in Figure 2
to account for the local 2-D ISI shape. The state transition
probability is computed using equation (19). The a-priori
information from the feedback pixels and P (ui,j ) is utilized
in an iterative fashion.

scheme. The row/column detectors pass soft extrinsic informa-

B. Turbo Based 2D Detection
The 2-D iterative scheme takes advantage of different error
decisions and noise distribution at the output of the row
and column detectors by feeding scaled extrinsic information
back and forth. We assume statistical independence when
computing the probability of the input and feedback pixels
using the a-priori information (i.e. the probabilities of all
the feedback pixels as per equation (19) and P (ui,j ) as
per equation (14)). The analysis for dependent statistics is
generally difﬁcult and is a future research topic.

single-row/column iterative detector. As shown in Figure 5,
algorithm E at BER 10 −6 is within 0.5 dB of the algorithms
C and D. At BER 10−6 , the iterative algorithms have 2 dB
SNR gain over the non-iterative ones.
Algorithm E with 10 iterations is 0.3% as complex as algorithm D with 5 iterations (complexity computations avoided
due to page limitations) with a SNR loss of about 0.5 dB at

III. S IMULATION R ESULTS
We present Monte Carlo simulation results of the 2-D
detection algorithms and compare their performance. All simulations employ a random 64×64 binary image with a boundary
corresponding to the mask size so that the trellis could start
and end with an all zero state. The SNR is deﬁned as in [12]:
||hx||2

σω

i,j h (i, j)

SNR = 10log10
= 10log10

where σω is the variance of the Gaussian r.v.s ω(m, n) in (2).
We assume α = β = 0.25 in the 3 × 3 mask h, for simulation
purposes.
Iterative algorithms C and D employ a 5-iteration scheme
with scale factor δ = 0.8. Algorithm E uses a 10-iteration
scheme with weight δ = 0.5. The performance of the algorithms converge, i.e. no more signiﬁcant SNR gain, after these
numbers of iterations mentioned here.
Algorithm B performs much better than algorithm A, since
the state transition probability is computed more accurately
(i.e. more contributing terms dealing with ISI rather than in
the single case).
Algorithms C and D spanning multi-rows/columns perform
better than algorithm E with simpliﬁed trellis because handling
