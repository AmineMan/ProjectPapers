Abstract—Maddah-Ali and Tse have recently shown that
delayed transmitter channel state information (CSIT) can still be
useful in increasing the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) over the MIMO
broadcast channel. This was achieved by constructing a scheme
that, in the presence of two transmit antennas, of two singleantenna receivers, and of CSIT that is delayed by one coherence
time, manages to provide each user with 2/3 DoF, improving
upon the 1/2 DoF corresponding to no CSIT. This same scheme
though, as well as all subsequent schemes pertinent schemes,
achieve DoF gains by suppressing the inherent diversity of the
broadcast parallel channel. The current work proposes a novel
broadcast scheme which, over the above described setting of the
delayed CSIT broadcast channel, employs a form of interference
alignment to achieve both full DoF as well as full diversity.

B. Outline
After describing the system model and brieﬂy recalling the
original MAT scheme, Section II describes the new DoFoptimal design, and Section III shows that the scheme achieves
full diversity. As a side result, the interested reader can ﬁnd
in Appendix VI an upper bound on the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff (DMT) of the MAT scheme.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Many multiuser wireless communications settings are
known to beneﬁt greatly from the use of CSIT feedback.
It is the case though that such feedback is often hard to
obtain sufﬁciently fast, and as a result, efforts have been
made to ﬁnd ways to utilize delayed CSIT. One such case
involves communication over the broadcast channel (BC),
where recent advances by Maddah-Ali and Tse [1] have
shown that stale CSIT can still allow for improvements in the
channel’s degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region. This same work
in [1] developed a novel scheme that, in the speciﬁc setting of
the multiple-input single-output (MISO) BC with 2 transmit
antennas and 2 users each with a single receive antenna, can
offer 2/3 DoF to each user, even when the CSIT is delayed
by a coherence period.
While achieving the optimal DoF, this novel scheme, as well
as subsequent pertinent techniques ( [2]–[7]), neglect diversity
considerations, thus resulting in substantial suboptimality with
respect to diversity. This suboptimality naturally contributes
to substantial performance degradation, and thus brings to the
fore the need for novel designs that can combine the signal
manipulations that allow for full diversity, with the signal
manipulations that utilize stale CSIT to give full DoF. We here
propose a novel design which employs interference alignment
[8] techniques to provide, in the aforementioned two-user
MISO BC with stale CSIT, full DoF and full diversity.

C. System model
As stated, we focus on the frequency-ﬂat MISO BC with
two transmit antennas and two users with a single receive
antenna. We consider a coherence period of T channel uses,
during which the channel remains the same. Speciﬁcally
we consider communication over L coherence periods, or
equivalently L phases, where each phase coincides with a
coherence period. During phase l (l = 1, · · · , L), the ﬁrst
user’s channel is denoted as hl = [hl,1 hl,2 ] ∈ C2 , and the
second user’s as g l = [gl,1 gl,2 ] ∈ C2 . For xl,t denoting
the transmitted signals during timeslot t of phase l, then the
corresponding received signals at the ﬁrst and second user
respectively, take the form

yl,t = hl xl,t + zl,t ,
= g l xl,t +
(1)

(2)

(t = 1, 2, · · · , T ), where zl,t , zl,t denotes the AWGN noise.
The fading coefﬁcients are assumed to be i.i.d. circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian CN (0, 1) distributed, and are
assumed to remain ﬁxed during a phase and change independently from phase to phase. We let ρ denote the signal-to-noise
ration (SNR), and we consider a short-term power constraint
where E||x (t)||2 ≤ ρ. We also consider a communication rate
of R bits per channel use, which is here taken to be the same
for both users. We recall that the corresponding DoF takes

A. Notation

rank(•) denote the inverse, transpose, conjugate transpose,

the form r = limρ→∞ logiρ , where r is also referred to as the
multiplexing gain. Finally, for Pe denoting the probability that
at least one user has decoded erroneously, we recall the notion
of diversity to be d = − limρ→∞ log Pe (cf. [9]).
log ρ
Regarding knowledge of the channel state, we assume
perfect channel state information at the receivers (perfect
CSIR), but we only allow the transmitter perfect knowledge of
CSIT with a delay of a single phase (single coherence time),
and provide no knowledge of current CSIT.
We consider the minimum delay case where communication, just as in [1], takes place over L = 3 phases, and we
note that naturally the achieved optimal DoF performance
cannot further beneﬁt from using L > 3 phases. The proposed
design is presented here for simplicity only for the minimum
phase-delay case (L = 3), for which it achieves the optimal
diversity of 6 (3 coherence intervals, 2 transmit antennas). We
note though that this design can be readily extended to the
case where L is a multiple of 3, to again achieve the optimal
diversity order of 2L. We will henceforth consider that L = 3.

II. I NTERFERENCE ALIGNMENT FOR ACHIEVING BOTH
FULL D O F AND FULL DIVERSITY
We brieﬂy note that the maximum achievable diversity that
we can hope for is 6, simply because the transmitter has 2
antennas and because communication takes place over L = 3
statistically independent channel realizations (L = 3 phases).
The scheme applies to the case where the coherence period
T is no less than 8. Without loss of generality, we will assume
that T = 8, and that the entire coding duration is LT = 24
channel uses, spanning three different phases of 8 channel
uses each. For l = 1, · · · , L, t = 1, · · · , T = 4, we denote by
2
xl,2t−1 the vectors transmitted during odd timeslots of phase
l (i.e., during timeslots 1, 3, 5, 7 of phase l), and we denote
by xl,2t (l = 1, · · · , L, t = 1, · · · , 4) the vectors transmitted
during even timeslots of phase l.
We assign 16 information symbols {a1,t , a2,t , a3,t , a4,t }4
t=1
to the ﬁrst user, and 16 symbols {b1,t , b2,t , b3,t , b4,t }4 to the
t=1
second user. Consequently for any given t = 1, 2, 3, 4, the
transmitted signal vectors are designed as follows

D. Original MAT scheme

x1,2t−1 = [a1,t + b1,t a3,t + b3,t ]

The MAT scheme [1] applies irrespective of the coherence
duration T , and it considers communication over L = 3
phases. Without consideration for the time index, in describing
the scheme, we denote by {a1 , a2 } the two symbols intended
for the ﬁrst user, and by {b1 , b2 } the symbols for the second
user. During the ﬁrst, second and third phase, the transmitter
sequentially sends x1 , x2 , x3 ∈ C2 where

III. D IVERSITY ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED SCHEME

Note that H AA ∈ C6×4 , H AB ∈ C6×4 , and that the rank of
[H AA H AB ] ∈ C6×8 can generally not support decoding of
[at bt ] ∈ C8 . This problem is bypassed by the structure of
the designed scheme which allows for aligning some of the
interference at the ﬁrst receiver (cf. Fig. 1), such that
¯
¯
H AB bt = H AB bt

We again focus, without loss of generality, on the ﬁrst
user, and consider joint ML decoding for the MAC channel
corresponding to (13). We remind the reader that we are
interested only in establishing the diversity of the scheme, i.e.,
we are interested in the case of r = 0 (R is ﬁxed). Directly
from [10] we know that the probability of error in this lightly
loaded regime (cf. [10]) is dominated by the outage event

In the setting of the two-user MISO broadcast channel
with delayed CSIT, we designed the ﬁrst scheme to achieve
full DoF as well as full diversity. The scheme borrows from
the techniques of interference alignment, which allow for
combining the signal manipulations that increase the DoF
with the signal manipulations that allow for full diversity.
Future work can extend the result by analyzing the entire DMT
behavior of the scheme, as well as extend the result to other
BC settings.
