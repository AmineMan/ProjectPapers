Abstract—Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are
widely used in storage systems to protect against disks (nodes)
failures. An (n, k, l ) MDS code uses n nodes of capacity l to
store k information nodes. The MDS property guarantees the
resiliency to any n − k node failures. An optimal bandwidth
(resp. optimal access) MDS code communicates (resp. accesses)
the minimum amount of data during the recovery process of
a single failed node. It was shown that this amount equals a
fraction of 1/(n − k) of data stored in each node. In previous
optimal bandwidth constructions, l scaled polynomially with k
in codes with asymptotic rate < 1. Moreover, in constructions
with constant number of parities, i.e. rate approaches 1, l scaled
exponentially w.r.t. k. In this paper we focus on the practical case
of n − k = 2, and ask the following question: Given the capacity
of a node l what is the largest (w.r.t. k) optimal bandwidth (resp.
access) (k + 2, k, l ) MDS code. We give an upper bound for the
general case, and two tight bounds in the special cases of two
important families of codes.

the more common scenario is the failure (erasure) of only one
node. [4] proved that

I. I NTRODUCTION
Erasure-correcting codes are the basis for widely used
storage systems, where disks (nodes) correspond to symbols
in the code. An important family of codes is the Maximum
distance separable (MDS) codes, which provide an optimal
resiliency to erasures for a given amount of redundancy.
Namely, an MDS code with r redundancy (parity) symbols can
recover the information from any r symbol erasures. Because
of this storage efﬁciency, MDS codes are highly favorable,
and a lot research has been done to construct them. Examples
of MDS codes are the well known Reed Solomon codes and
EVENODD. It is evident that in the case of r erasures, one
needs to communicate the entire surviving information during
the recovery process. However, although the MDS codes
used in practice, are resilient to more than a single erasure,
i.e. number of parity nodes r > 1, the practical and more
interesting question is; what is the minimum repair bandwidth
in a single node erasure. The repair bandwidth is deﬁned as
the amount of information communicated during the recovery
process. This question has received much interest recently
due to both its practical and theoretical importance. From a
practical point of view, decreasing the repair bandwidth makes
both the recovery process, and the inaccessibility time of the
erased information, shorter. Moreover, from the theoretical
perspective this question has deep connections to the widely
used interference alignment technique and network coding.

is a lower bound on the repair bandwidth for an (n, k, l )
MDS code. In particular, for a code with r = 2 parities,
l
the repair bandwidth for each surviving node is 2 , i.e. at
least one half of its information needs to be communicated.
Note that recovery is possible since the code is resilient to
more than one erasure, and a repair strategy of communicating
the entire remaining information sufﬁces. An MDS code is
termed optimal bandwidth if it achieves the lower bound
in (1) during the recovery process of all of its systematic
nodes1 . Figure 1 shows an optimal bandwidth (6, 4, 2) MDS
code. For recovering an erased node, one bit of information
is transmitted to the repair center from each surviving node.
In some applications such as data centers, reading (accessing)
the information is more costly than transmitting it. Therefore
during a recovery process, the need to transmit data that is a
function of a large portion of the information stored within a
node, can cause a bottleneck. E.g., node N1 needs to access
its entire stored information, for it to calculate a + w, during
the recovery process of node N3. Therefore, in a large scale
storage systems, one might need to minimize not only the
amount of information transmitted, but also the number of
accessed information elements. An optimal access MDS code

A. The Problem

1 The relaxed requirement of optimal recovery only for the systematic nodes
is reasonable, because in most storage systems the number of parity nodes
is negligible compared to systematic nodes. Moreover, in an erasure of a
systematic node, the raw information is not accessible, as opposed to a parity
node erasure.

The problem of efﬁcient recovery was deﬁned by Dimakis
et. al. in [4]. It considers a ﬁle of size M divided into k
equally sized chunks stored using an (n, k, l ) MDS code,

is an optimal bandwidth code that transmits only the elements
it accesses. By deﬁnition, any optimal access code is also
an optimal bandwidth code. The shortened code restricted to
nodes { N1 , N2 , Parity 1, Parity 2} in Figure 1 is an example
of an optimal access (4, 2, 2) MDS code.
In a value’s update of a stored element, one needs to
update each parity node at least once. To avoid an overload
on the system during a frequent operation such as updating,
one needs to design an optimal update code, that updates
exactly once in each parity node, when an element changes its
value. E.g. in Figure 1 the shortened code restricted to nodes
{ N3 , N4 , Parity 1, Parity 2} is an optimal update and optimal
bandwidth (4, 2, 2) MDS code, because, updating any of the
elements c, d, y, z will require updating exactly one element in
each of the parity nodes.
Various codes [4], [7]–[9], [11], [15]–[17] were constructed
with the goal to have optimal bandwidth, however these
constructions all have low rate, i.e., k/n ≤ 1/2. In [9],
[11], [17] the key idea was using vector coding. Namely,
each symbol in a codeword is a vector and not scalar as in
“standard” codes. Speciﬁcally [9], [11] constructed optimal
bandwidth (2k, k, k) MDS codes. Using interference alignment
it was shown in [3] that the bound in (1) is asymptotically
achievable also for high rate codes (k/n ≥ 1/2) . The question
of existence of optimal bandwidth codes with high rate, was
resolved in several constructions [1], [2], [5], [6], [12], [13],
[18]. The constructions have an arbitrary number of parity
nodes r, however when r is constant, i.e. rate approaching 1
in all of the constructions k = O(logr l ), i.e., the capacity l
scales exponentially with the number of systematic nodes k.

codes are a part of an important family of codes with an
optimal update property. The last result provides a tight bound
on optimal access MDS codes. Table I summarizes the known
results together with our new results. Due to space limitation
we only consider the more practical case of r = 2 parities,
although the results can be extended to an arbitrary r. Some
of the proofs are also omitted and can be found in [14].
C. Settings and Notation
Consider a ﬁle of size M = kl, divided into k nodes of
capacity l. Each systematic node 1 ≤ i ≤ k is represented
by an l × 1 vector ai ∈ Flp over the ﬁeld F p . We construct
an (k + 2, k, l ) MDS code by adding parity nodes k + 1 and
k + 2, which will give the resiliency to node erasures. Parity
node k + i for i ∈ {1, 2} stores the information vector ak+i
of length l over F p , and is deﬁned as
k

∑ Ai ai , and ak+2 = ∑ Bi ai .

Where Ai , Bi are square matrices of order l, which are called
the encoding matrices. Note that the code has a systematic
structure, i.e., the ﬁrst k nodes store the information itself, and
not a function of it. Therefore, the code is deﬁned uniquely
by the matrix

B1 B2 ... Bk
The code is called an MDS if it can recover from any 2 node
erasures, which is equivalent to any 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 block
sub matrix in (2) is invertible. In a scenario of an erasure
of a systematic node i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, a linear combination
of the information stored in the parity nodes is transmitted
in order to recover the lost data. Namely, the parity nodes
k + 1, and k + 2, project their data on the recovering subspaces
Si , Ti of dimension l/2, respectively. In other words, the
transmitted information from parity nodes k + 1, k + 2 during
the recovery process of systematic node i ∈ [k] is the
projection Si ak+1 , Ti ak+2 respectively. where each subspace
Si , Ti is represented by an l/2 × l matrix whose rows form
a basis of the subspace. In general, each subspace will be
represented by a matrix whose rows form a basis of the
subspace. Recovering the lost information is possible if

B. Our Contribution
Our main goal in this paper is to understand the relation
between l the capacity of each node, and the number of
systematic nodes k. More precisely, given the capacity of the
node l, what is the largest integer k, such that there exists an
optimal bandwidth or optimal access (k + 2, k, l ) MDS code.
We will derive three upper bounds on k as a function of only l,
for different families of codes. To derive the bounds we use 3
different combinatorial techniques. The ﬁrst bound considers
the general problem, where no requirements on the MDS
code are imposed except the optimal bandwidth property. The
bound is derived by deﬁning an appropriate set of multivariate
polynomials. We proceed by deriving a tight bound for optimal
bandwidth MDS codes with diagonal encoding matrices. These

Similar conditions were derived in [9]. Therefore an optimal
bandwidth algorithm for the systematic nodes is deﬁned by
the pairs of recovering subspaces (Si , Ti ) that satisfy (3), (4)
for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. For any integer k denote by [k] = {1, ..., k}.
For simplicity we will assume that the capacity of each node
l, is a power of 2, and all the logarithms are of base 2.

2 The result we present considers a special case of optimal update code,
where the encoding matrices are diagonal.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II deﬁnes the subspace property for a set of matrices, and
shows the equivalency of this property to optimal bandwidth
codes. Section III provides an upper bound for the most general case, i.e., an MDS code with optimal bandwidth property.
We proceed in Section IV where a tight bound is derived for
codes with diagonal encoding matrices. In SectionV a tight
bound for codes with optimal access property is derived. We
conclude with a summary in Section VI .

III. U PPER BOUND ON THE NUMBER OF NODES IN AN
OPTIMAL BANDWIDTH MDS CODE
We start with the most general problem which seems to
be the hardest of them all. We impose no constraints on the
encoding matrices and the recovering subspaces. We derive
an upper bound on the number of information nodes k in an
optimal bandwidth (k + 2, k, l ) MDS code. The bound is a
function of only the capacity of the node l, regardless the
ﬁeld size being used.
Before we prove the upper bound, for a set of indexes of
equal size I, J deﬁne det( B) I,J to be the determinant of the
matrix of B restricted to rows I and columns J.

In this section we deﬁne the Subspace Property for a set
of invertible matrices, and show its connection to optimal
bandwidth MDS codes.

By the previous Theorem, we assume that any optimal

which satisfy this property.
From the last Theorem we have the following Corollary.

It is clear that a vector v = 0 is an eigenvector for all
the matrices Ci , i = j iff v ∈ span(ex ), for some set x in
the partition X. Assume S is represented in its reduced row
echelon form. Since S is an invariant subspace for Ci , i = j,
it is clear that each row vector in S is an eigenvector for each
of the matrices Ci , i = j. Hence for each row of S, the set of
indices of the nonzero entries is contained in some set of the
partition X. Therefore,

Proof: The upper bound is a consequence of Corollary
2 and Theorem 3, the lower bound is given by the code
constructed in [19].
As one can notice, there exists a big gap between the upper
and the lower bound. We conjecture that the lower bound is
more accurate, and in fact k = θ (log l ).
We proceed by giving a tight bound for the number of
systematic nodes k in the case where all the encoding matrices
are diagonal.

S = ⊕ x∈X Sx ,
where Sx = S ∩ span(ex ). Let x ∈ X, and note that
dim(Sx ) = | x |/2. Since, if Sx > | x |/2 and the fact
that span(ex ) is also an invariant subspace of Cj we get
Sx Cj , Sx ⊂ span(ex ). Hence Sx Cj ∩ Sx = {0}, which
contradicts the subspace property. Moreover, since

One of the most common operations in the maintenance
of storage systems is updating. Namely, a certain element
changed its value, and that needs to be updated in the system.
Since the code is an MDS, each parity node is a function
of the entire systematic nodes. Therefore in a single update,
each parity node needs to be updated at least in one of the
elements it stores. An optimal update code is one that needs
to update each parity node exactly once in an update of any
information element. We derive a tight bound in a special case
of an optimal update code, where all the encoding matrices
are diagonal. We begin with a simple Lemma on an entropy.

Before we proceed to prove the upper bound, recall that the
meet of two partitions X, Y of some set, is deﬁned as,

Pick randomly and with equal probability a vector v from the
standard basis, and deﬁne for i ∈ [k ] the random variable Yi
to be the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector v in Ci .

is no difference if the code is an optimal access or optimal
bandwidth (see Table I). In the next section we show that these
two properties are not equivalent in the general case.

the general case of optimal bandwidth code. The last two
bounds are tight, and they consider optimal access and optimal
update codes. Moreover, we showed that in the general case,
the properties of optimal bandwidth and optimal access are
not equivalent. Although in some certain codes such as codes
with diagonal encoding matrices, they are indeed equivalent.
It is an open problem what is the longest optimal bandwidth
code with capacity l .

V. U PPER B OUND ON THE NUMBER OF NODES FOR
O PTIMAL ACCESS
Recall that in an optimal bandwidth MDS codes the transmitted information can be a function of the entire information
in the node. Namely, in order to generate the transmitted data,
one has to access all the information stored in the node, which
of course can be an expensive task. An optimal access code
is an optimal bandwidth code that transmits only the elements
it accesses. The property of Optimal Access is equivalent to
that each recovering subspace Si is spanned by an l/2-subset
of the standard basis e1 , ..., el , i.e., Si = span(em : m ∈ I ) for
some I an l/2-subset of [l ].
We start with an useful lemma that shows that the set of
subspaces S1 , ..., Sk do not have large intersections.

Moreover, The number of subspaces {Si }i=1 that contain an
arbitrary vector v = 0 is at most log l.

Proof: Proof is omitted.
The previous Lemma shows that an arbitrary vector v = 0
can not belong to “too many” subspaces Si . This observation
gives a tight bound on the number of nodes k in an optimal
access code, as the following theorem shows.
Theorem 9 Let C1 , ..., Ck be a set of invertible matrices of
order l that satisfy the subspace property with subspaces
S1 , ..., Sk . If each subspace Si is spanned by an l/2-subset of
the standard basis e1 , ..., el , then k ≤ 2 log l.
Proof: Prove by Lemma 8 and a counting argument.
Corollary 10 Let k be the largest integer such that there exists
an optimal access (k + 2, k, l ) MDS code, then k = 2 log l.
Proof: The lower bound is derived by the code constructed in [1], [19].
Note that [19] constructed also an optimal bandwidth code
with k = 3 log l. Therefore, in the general case where we
do not require an optimal update code, there is a difference
between optimal access and optimal bandwidth code. Namely,
these two properties are not equivalent (see Table I).
VI. SUMMARY
In this paper we considered optimal bandwidth (resp. access) MDS codes with two parities. Speciﬁcally we asked,
given the capacity of each node l what is the largest possible
integer k such that there exists an optimal bandwidth (resp.
access) (k + 2, k, l ) MDS code. We used distinct combinatorial
tools to derive 3 upper bounds on k. The ﬁrst bound considers
