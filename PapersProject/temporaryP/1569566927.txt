In [7], a distributed rateless code with an unequal error
protection (UEP) property has been proposed for the same
system model as in [5]. In fact, different data importance
levels necessitate the design of distributed rateless codes
with different error probabilities for different sources. Various
block lengths and degree distributions have been considered
at different source nodes. Degree distributions in [7] have
been optimized using a multi-objective optimization approach.
However, cooperation between the users has not been considered.
In this paper a distributed rateless coding (DRC) scheme
is proposed for a two-user MAC. In the proposed scheme,
each user keeps transmitting their rateless coded symbols until
its message can be completely decoded by the other user or
an acknowledgment is received from the destination. After
successful recovery of one user’s message by the other user
but not by the destination, cooperation process starts. Each
user encodes both users’ message by a rateless code and
transmit them to the destination until both users’ messages are
recovered by the destination. The proposed scheme is analyzed
using the AND-OR tree analysis [8] and degree distributions
are optimized by using a linear programming optimization
approach. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme
outperforms the non-cooperative rateless coded scheme where
each user’s message is transmitted only by itself without
cooperation with the other user. When the erasure probability
of the inter-user channel is low, the proposed scheme performs
very close to the perfect-cooperation scheme where each user’s
message is assumed to be known at the other user.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
the system model and the DRC scheme is described. AND-OR
tree analysis of the DRC scheme is provided in Section III.
In Section IV, a suboptimum optimization problem is deﬁned
to ﬁnd an appropriate degree distribution. Simulation results
are provided in Section V, followed by concluding remarks in
Section VI.

Abstract—In this paper, we propose a distributed rateless
coding (DRC) scheme for a two-user cooperative system. In
DRC, the overall transmission is divided into two phases, a
broadcast phase and a cooperation phase. In the broadcast
phase, each user keeps transmitting its rateless coded symbols
to the other user and the destination until its message has been
successfully decoded by the destination or the other user. In the
cooperation phase, each user encodes both users’ messages by
using a rateless code and transmits them to the destination. A
linear programming optimization problem is then formulated to
ﬁnd the optimal degree distribution for the proposed distributed
rateless code. The performance of the proposed code is analyzed
and validated by simulations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Rateless code is a class of powerful error correction codes.
They are rateless in the sense that they are able to generate
an unlimited number of parity symbols. The design process
of rateless codes is mainly comprised of determining an
appropriate degree distribution [1]. Recently, rateless codes
have been applied to coded cooperation [2] to further improve
transmission efﬁciency and performance.
In [3], a rateless coded cooperation scheme has been
proposed for a two-user multiple access channel (MAC). In
this scheme, one user helps to forward other user’s message
only after its message has been successfully received by
the destination and it has completely decoded other user’s
message. In [4], a coded cooperation scheme based on rateless
codes was designed for multi-user MACs, where each user
cannot start the cooperation process until it has fully recovered
other users’ messages. Its performance has been investigated
by simulations, but no analysis and degree optimization has
been carried out. Puducheri et. al. [5] proposed a distributed
rateless coding scheme, where an intermediate relay node
combines all incoming rateless coded symbols from sources.
The degree distribution of rateless codes used at sources was
designed in a way such that the combined symbols at the relay
follow the standard Robust Soliton degree (RSD) distribution.
The idea is further extended in [6], where incoming messages
from sources are encoded using a degree distribution which
is different from that used at sources, and suboptimal degree
distributions have been obtained for both the source and relay
node.

In this paper, we consider a two-user cooperative multiple
access channel, where two users, namely S1 and S2 , want to
transmit their information symbols to the destination cooperatively. The channel between each pair of nodes is considered

System model

to be an erasure channel with a speciﬁc erasure probability
(Fig. 1).
Each user uses an LT code [9] to encode its information
messages. LT encoding process contains two important steps;
ﬁrst, an integer d, called degree, is obtained from a predeﬁned
degree distribution. Then, d distinct information symbols are
randomly selected and XORed to generate a coded symbol.
D
Let Ω(x) = i=1 Ωi xi be the generator polynomial of the
degree distribution, where Ωi denotes the probability that a
coded symbol has degree i, D is the maximum degree, and
D
i=1 Ωi = 1. The LT encoding process can be described by a
bipartite graph, where the variable and check nodes represent
message symbols and LT coded symbols, respectively [1].
The overall transmission of the DRC scheme is divided into
two phases, a broadcast phase and a cooperative phase. In
the broadcast phase, each user generates coded symbols from
its own message symbols using degree distribution Ω(x) and
keeps transmitting them to the other user and the destination
until it receives an acknowledgement from either the other user
or the destination. If both users’ messages are successfully
decoded at the destination before they are recovered by the
other user, the destination will send an acknowledgment to
both users. Then the sources start broadcasting new messages.
Otherwise, the user that has successfully recovered the other
user’s message starts the cooperation phase and encodes both
users’ messages using an LT code with degree distribution
Φ(x) and two users sequentially transmits coded symbols to
the destination. When the destination successfully decodes
both users’ messages, it sends an acknowledgement to both
users. Then each user starts a new message transmission.
Throughout the paper the following notations are used. k is
the message length of each user. N1 and N2 are total numbers
of the received coded symbols from S1 and S2 , respectively,
at the destination in the broadcast phase, and N3 is the total
number of the coded symbols received in the cooperation
phase from both users. Also, Ω′ (x) denotes the derivative of
Ω(x).

variable nodes if and only if it has received at least one
message with value ”0” from its neighboring variable nodes.
Thus, check nodes perform the logical AND operation [7].
Since coded symbols received at the destination are generated
from both user’s information symbols, three types of LT coded
symbols exist at the destination. In the bipartite graph, coded
symbols that are only connected to S1 (S2 )’s information
symbols are referred to as Type-1 (Type-2) coded symbols
and those connected to both users’ information symbols are
called as Type-3 coded symbols.
Therefore, in the AND-OR trees of the DRC scheme, three
types of coded symbols are mapped to Type-C1 , Type-C2 , and
Type-C3 AND nodes, and information symbols of S1 and S2
are mapped to Type-X1 and Type-X2 OR nodes, respectively.
We consider two AND-OR trees, Tl,1 and Tl,2 , with depth 2l
(Fig. 2), such that the root of Tl,1 is a Type-X1 AND node
and the root of Tl,2 is a Type-X2 AND node. Both trees have
Type-X1 and Type-X2 OR nodes, and Type-C1 , Type-C2 , and
Type-C3 AND nodes, where OR nodes are located at depth
0, 2, ..., 2l and AND nodes are located at depth 1, 3, ..., 2l − 1.
Furthermore, AND nodes at depth 2i − 1 has children among
OR nodes at depth 2i, and children of OR nodes at depth 2j
are from AND nodes at depth 2j + 1.
In the AND-OR tree, Type-C1 (Type-C2) AND nodes are
only connected to Type-X1 (Type-X2) OR nodes. A Type-Xi
OR node at depth 2l is independently assigned a value of 0 or
1, with the probability of p0,i = 1. The OR-nodes and ANDnodes, which do not have children, are assigned a value of ”0”
and ”1”, respectively. By treating the tree as a Boolean circuit,
we can derive the following lemma for the error probability
of the DRC scheme using AND-OR tree analysis (see the
appendix for the proof).
Lemma 1: Let pl,m , m = 1, 2, be the probability that an
information symbol of Sm is not recovered after l iterations,
then we have:

SCHEME

In [1, 7], it was shown that iterative belief propagation
decoding of rateless codes can be mapped to an AND-OR tree
to analyze the recovery probability of an information symbol.
The details of such mapping can be found in [7, 8]. More
speciﬁcally, in the belief propagation decoding algorithm, at
each iteration, a variable node sends a symbol ”1” to its
neighboring check nodes if and only if it has received at least
one message with value ”1” from its other neighboring check
nodes. Thus variable nodes perform the logical OR operation.
Similarly, a check node passes a symbol ”0” to its neighboring

which arises form the fact that a coded symbol of degree
d is actually of degree d + w with probability Φd+w before removing all edges connected to the known symbols.
Since d + w information symbols are selected uniformly and
randomly from 2k information symbols to generate a coded
symbol in the cooperation phase, then (6) is straightforward.
Furthermore, Eq. (7) shows that Φ∗ = 0, which means after
0
removing all the edges connected to the known information
symbols, some coded symbols may not have connections to
any information symbol. Thus these coded symbols should be
removed from the tanner graph and the degree distribution of
the remaining coded symbols will be:

that the iterative belief propagation algorithm can proceed by
keeping the number of degree-one coded symbols larger than

If the receiver already knows one user’s information symbols, it can remove all the edges connected to the known
symbols in the tanner graph. The probability that a coded
symbol has a degree d can be calculated as follows:

From Lemma 1, we can deﬁne an optimization problem
to minimize the error probability of S1 and S2 at a speciﬁc
decoding iteration l, denoted by pl,1 and pl,2 , respectively.
However, to ﬁnd the optimum degree distribution, N1 , N2 ,
and N3 need to be known beforehand. Since, these values
depend on channel erasure probabilities, they cannot be found
without the knowledge of the channel erasure probability. As
a result, a sub-optimum degree distribution may be used.
According to [1], in order to ensure the successful recovery
of 2k information symbols with a minimum overhead, the
derivative of Φ(x) should satisfy the following condition,
Φ′ (x) ≥ −r0 ln 1 − x − c

,

Using (7) and (8), (9) can be rewritten in terms of Φ(x) as in
(13). It is also important to ﬁnd the degree distribution with
minimum average degree in order to minimize the encoding
complexity. So, the optimization problem can be formulated
as follows:

dΦd are average
dΩd and µ2 =
where µ1 =
degrees of degree distribution functions, Ω(x) and Φ(x),
which are the degree distributions used at the broadcast and
cooperation phase of the DRC scheme..

In fact, (12)-(11), and the objective function are linear in

the optimized degree distribution obtained by this method is

and r1 = 0.7844.
Furthermore, in the broadcast phase, each user only encodes
its own information symbols, and so we ﬁnd the degree
distribution which guarantees a successful decoding with a
minimum overhead. So, in the broadcast phase, we use the
same optimization problem as in [1]. The obtained degree
distribution for δ = 0.01 and k = 10000 is Ω(x) =
0.01x+0.487x2 +0.1654x3 +0.1055x4 +0.12x7 +0.0192x8 +

coded symbols divided by the number of information symbols
for LT codes with different degree distributions Ω(x), Φ(x),
and Φ(1) (x), that are obtained by the optimization technique
provided in this section. It can be noted from Fig. 3 that 2k
information symbols can be recovered by receiving at least
1.12 × 2k coded symbols generated by a LT code with Φ(x).
Also k information symbols can be completely decoded with a
high probability by using a LT code with Φ(1) (x) and receiving
at least 1.23k coded symbols.

coded symbols to perform a successful decoding. Similarly,
S2 should send k(1 + δk )/(1 − e2 ) coded symbols. If e1 =
e2 = e, then, the users should send overall 2k(1 + δk )/(1 − e)
coded symbols to the destination to guarantee that both users’
messages can be decoded successfully.
In the Perfect-cooperation scheme, the destination needs to
receive at least 2k(1 + δ2k ) coded symbols in order to fully
decode both users’ messages. Thus, users should send overall
2k(1 + δ2k )/(1 − e) coded symbols (e1 = e2 = e). Since, δk
and δ2k go to zero when k goes to inﬁnity, the total number
of symbols required for a successful transmission in both Nocooperation and Perfect-cooperation schemes will be the same
when k is relatively large. Therefore, in the symmetric case,
for a relatively large k, the cooperation between the users
cannot improve error performance at the destination.
Fig. 4 shows the ratio of the total number of transmitted
symbols (N ) and that of information symbols (K = 2k) versus
different erasure probabilities of the inter-user channel. Two
Scenarios, namely Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, are considered
in simulations. In Scenario 1, e1 = 0.2, e2 = 0.8, and in
Scenario 2, e1 = 0.3, e2 = 0.6. As can be seen in Fig 4, the

RESULTS

We consider that the channel between the users is reciprocal,
i.e., e12 = e21 . The proposed scheme is compared with
No-cooperation and Perfect-cooperation schemes. In the Nocooperation scheme, each user only transmits rateless coded
symbols from its own message. In the Perfect-cooperation
scheme, each user’s message is assumed to be perfectly known
to the other user, so each user generates coded symbols from
both users’ messages.
In the No-cooperation scheme, S1 ’s information symbols
will be decoded as soon as the destination receives at least
k(1 + δk ) coded symbols, where δk is the average overhead
required to ensure a successful decoding at the destination.
Since the symbols transmitted from S1 may be erased, S1
should transmit at least k(1 + δk )/(1 − e1 ) coded symbols
to ensure that the destination receives an adequate number of

DRC scheme outperforms the No-cooperation scheme when
the erasure probability of the inter-user channel is lower than
that of the channel between the users and the destination.
Also, for the very small erasure probability of the inter-user
channel, the DRC scheme performs very close to the Perfectcooperation scheme. Analytical results obtained from lemma 1
have been also provided in Fig. 4 and an excellent agreement
with the simulation results has been demonstrated.
Fig. 5 shows the number of coded symbols (M ) that should
be received from each user to guarantee its successful receipt
at the destination. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that when
S1 has better channel to the destination, it needs to send more
coded symbols compared to S2 . This is because the proposed
scheme aims to jointly decode both users’ messages with minimum overhead at the destination, instead of decoding them
separately. Hence, compared to the No-cooperation scheme,
more coded symbols from S1 are required at the destination
to decode S1 ’s message. Although a large overhead is required
to decode S1 ’s message, the overall overhead required for
decoding both users’ message is considerable lower compared
to the No-cooperation scheme.

probability that a randomly chosen

This is the probability that the edge is connected to a degreei + j + 1 Type-C3 AND node which have i Type-X1 and j
Type-X2 OR nodes of children. Since information symbols
from both users are selected uniformly and randomly in the
encoding process during the cooperation phase, the probability

Similar results can be found for δ3 where the total number of

2Φ(0.5)) and α3 = N3 /2k. Then, we have δ3 (x) = eα3 (x−1) .
This completes the proof.

The proof of (1) is straightforward and is similar to the
proof of [5, lemma1] and is not provided here due to space
limitation. We just prove the rest of the lemma. The proof is
provided only for Tl,1 , and due to the symmetry, similar results
can be proven for Tl,2 . Since a degree-d coded symbol in the
cooperation phase is generated from both users’ information
symbols based on degree distribution Φ(x), the probability that
this symbol is not connected to any information symbol of S2
in the tanner graph is 2−d . Therefore, the probability that a
coded symbol is not connected to any information symbol of
B
S2 is Φ(0.5) = d=1 Φd 2−d . Hence, the number of Type-C1
AND nodes is actually N1 + N3 Φ(0.5), where N1 of them
have been generated in the broadcast phase based on Ω(x)
and N3 Φ(0.5) of them have been generated in the cooperation
phase.
Additionally, β1,i is the probability that a randomly chosen
edge in Tl,1 is connected to a Type-C1 AND node with i
children among Type-X1 OR nodes and it is also equal to
the probability that this edge is connected to a Type-C1 AND
node of degree i + 1. So N1 (i + 1)Ωi+1 out of N1 µ1 edges
connected to Type-C1 AND nodes are actually connected to
degree-(i + 1) Type-C1 AND nodes. Similarly, N3 Φ(0.5)(i +
