Abstract—Optimal trellis-coded modulation (TCM) schemes
are obtained by jointly designing the convolutional encoder
and the binary labeling of the constellation. Unfortunately this
approach is infeasible for large encoder memories or constellation
sizes. Traditional TCM designs circumvent this problem by using
a labeling that follows the set-partitioning principle and by
performing an exhaustive search over the encoders. Therefore,
traditional TCM schemes are not necessarily optimal. In this
paper, we study binary labelings for TCM and show how they
can be grouped into classes, which considerably reduces the
search space in a joint design. For the particular case of 8-ary
modulation the search space for the labelings is reduced from 8!
to 240. Using this classiﬁcation, we formally prove that for any
channel it is always possible to design a TCM system based on
the binary-reﬂected Gray code with identical performance to the
one proposed by Ungerboeck in 1982. Moreover, the classiﬁcation
is used to tabulate asymptotically optimal TCM schemes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Trellis-coded modulation (TCM) systems are commonly
constructed by coupling a convolutional encoder and a constellation labeled using the set-partitioning (SP) principle.
TCM was introduced in [1], quickly adopted in the modem
standards in the early 90s, and it is a well studied topic,
cf. [2], [3, Ch. 18]. As an alternative to TCM, bit-interleaved
coded modulation (BICM) [4], [5] was introduced in 1992.
BICM is usually referred to as a pragmatic approach for coded
modulation and is well suited for fading channels.
In this paper we study binary labelings for TCM. Of
particular interest are the binary reﬂected Gray code (BRGC)
[6] and the natural binary code (NBC) [7]. The BRGC is often
used in BICM designs because it maximizes the BICM mutual
information for medium and high signal-to-noise ratios [5,
Sec. III] and the NBC is often used in TCM designs because
it follows the SP principle when it is used with constellations
having certain symmetries, cf. [1, Fig. 4], [8, Fig. 3].
The performance of BICM for the additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) channel can be improved if the interleaver
is removed [9], a conﬁguration that was later called “BICM
with trivial interleavers” (BICM-T) in [10]. BICM-T was
recognized as a TCM transmitter used with a BICM receiver
and it was shown to perform asymptotically as well as TCM if

how a transformation (binary addition) can be included in the mapper (to go
from (b) to (a)) or in the code (to go from (b) to (c)).

the convolutional encoder is properly selected [10, Table III]
and the BRGC is used. The transmitters in [1, Table I] and
[10, Table III] for the 8-state (memory ν = 3) convolutional
encoder1 are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 1 (c), respectively.
The authors in [10] failed to note that in fact the optimal
BICM-T conﬁguration is equivalent to the one proposed by
Ungerboeck 30 years earlier. For a 4-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) constellation (shown in Fig. 1), Ungerboeck’s
SP mapper (which is in this case equivalent to the NBC) can be
generated using the BRGC mapper plus one binary addition
(transform) applied to its inputs, as shown in Fig. 1(b). If
the transform is included in the mapper, the conﬁguration
in Fig. 1(a) is obtained, while if it is included in the code,
the conﬁguration in Fig. 1(c) is obtained. This equivalence
also applies to convolutional encoders with larger number
of memories2 and simply reveals that a TCM transmitter

based on a BRGC mapper will have identical performance
to Ungerboeck’s TCM if the encoder is properly modiﬁed.
The previous discussion raises the question about the use
of non-SP labelings for TCM. This problem has indeed been
studied in the literature, see for example [11, Sec. 13.2.1,
Problem 13–11], [3, Example 18.2] or the so-called pragmatic
TCM [12, Ch. 8], [13]. In [9], a binary labeling for BICMT was heuristically proposed for M PAM constellations for
M = 4, 8, 16. Traditional TCM designs either optimize the
convolutional encoder for a constellation using an SP labeling,
cf. [1], [8], or simply connect a convolutional encoder designed
for binary transmission with an ad-hoc binary labeling (Gray
in [14] and non-Gray in [13]). TCM designs based on SP
are considered heuristic [15, pp. 525, 531], and thus, they do
not necessarily lead to an optimal design [11, p. 680]. Indeed,
Ungerboeck’s TCM design is based on heuristic rules that aim
to increase the Euclidean distance (ED) when compared with
uncoded transmission with the same spectral efﬁciency. This
discussion raises another question, namely, the optimal joint
design of the convolutional encoder and the labeling.
To the best of our knowledge there are no works formally
addressing the joint design of the convolutional encoder and
the labeling of a TCM system. In this paper we study this
problem and formally prove that for any channel, binary
labelings can be grouped into different classes that will result
in equivalent TCM transmitters. The classes are closely related
to the Hadamard classes introduced in [16] in the context of
vector quantization. The proposed classiﬁcation allows us to
formally prove that in any TCM system the NBC labeling can
be replaced by many other labelings (including the BRGC),
provided that the convolutional encoder is properly modiﬁed.

A. Notation Convention
Throughout this paper, scalars are denoted by italic letters x,
row vectors are denoted by boldface letters x = [x1 , . . . , xN ],
and matrices by capital boldface letters X. Sets are denoted
using calligraphic letters C and the binary set is deﬁned as
B
{0, 1}. Binary addition is denoted by a ⊕ b. We use
Rm to denote the set of all reduced column echelon binary
matrices of size M × m (see Section III) and Tm to denote
the set of all invertible m × m binary matrices.
B. System Model
We consider the TCM encoder shown in Fig. 2 where a
feedforward convolutional encoder of rate R = k/m is serially
connected to a mapper ΦL where the index L emphasizes the
dependency of the mapper on the labeling (deﬁned later). At
each discrete time instant n, the information bits i1,n , . . . , ik,n
are fed to the convolutional encoder, which is fully determined
by k shift registers and the way the input sequences are
connected (through the registers) to its outputs. We denote
the length of the pth shift register by νp , with p = 1, . . . , k,
the overall constraint length (or memory of the convolutional
k
encoder) by ν = p=1 νp , and the number of states by 2ν .

Proof: Let v q
[0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0] be a vector of
length M , where the one is in position q. Thus cq = v q L
for q = 1, . . . , M . The mapping ΦL satisﬁes by deﬁnition
ΦL (cq ) = sq or, making the dependency on L explicit,

Theorem 1 tells us that an exhaustive search over Gk,m,ν
and Lm will include many pairs of equivalent TCM encoders.
Therefore, an optimal TCM encoder with given parameters
can be found by searching over a subset of Gk,m,ν and the
whole set Lm or vice versa. In this paper, we choose the latter
approach, searching over a subset of Lm .
A reduced column echelon matrix4 is, in the context of
binary labelings, deﬁned as a binary labeling matrix in which
(i) the ﬁrst “1” in any column is in a row where all other
elements are “0” and (ii) the number of leading zeros decreases
in every column. The matrix N 3 in Example 1 (or more
generally N m ) is an example of a reduced column echelon
matrix. On the other hand, B m is not a reduced column
echelon matrix. The following theorem, adapted from [17,
p. 187, Corollary 1] to the concept of reduced column echelon
matrices, shows an important matrix factorization which will
be used in Example 2 and Theorem 3.

For a given constellation S and a given ν, a TCM encoder
is fully deﬁned by the convolutional encoder matrix G and the
labeling of the constellation L. In this paper, a TCM encoder is
deﬁned by the pair Θ = [G, L]. For given integers k, m, and ν,
we deﬁne the convolutional encoder universe as the set Gk,m,ν
of all (ν + k) × m binary matrices G.3 In [1], [8] Ungerboeck
optimized TCM codes in terms of the minimum ED over all
possible convolutional codes for well-structured one- and twodimensional constellations and a labeling L that follows the SP
principle, e.g., the NBC. On the other hand, in [10, Sec. IV-C]
BICM-T systems over all G ∈ G1,2,ν (R = 1/2 and 4PAM)
and L = B 2 were optimized. We are also interested in the
labeling universe, deﬁned for a given integer m as the set Lm
of all M × m binary matrices whose M rows are all distinct.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no works addressing
the problem of designing a TCM encoder by exhaustively
searching over the labeling universe and the convolutional encoder universe. In this paper, we show how a joint optimization
over all G ∈ Gk,m,ν and L ∈ Lm can be restricted, without
loss of generality, to a joint optimization over all G ∈ Gk,m,ν
and over a subset of Lm .

The output of a given TCM encoder Θ = [G, L] at time n

where T ∈ Tm and LR ∈ Rm .
Theorem 2 shows that all binary matrices L can be uniquely
generated by ﬁnding all the invertible matrices T (the set Tm )
and all the different reduced column echelon matrices LR (the
set Rm ). In particular, we have [16, eq. (18)] MT |Tm | =

are shown. In view of Theorem 1 and Table I, for a joint
design and 8-ary constellations (m = 3), the total number of
different binary labelings that must be tested is reduced from
8! = 40320 to 240.
A modiﬁed Hadamard class is deﬁned as the set of matrices
L that can be generated via (7) using the same reduced column

commonly used reduced row echelon matrix [17, pp. 183–184] is a transpose.

Thus, the BRGC and the NBC of order m = 2 belong to the
same modiﬁed Hadamard class, and convolutional encoders
can be chosen to make the two resulting TCM encoders equivalent. This was illustrated in Fig. 1, where the transform block
corresponds to the transform matrix T = [[1, 1]T , [0, 1]T ]T =
T −1 . Since N 2 = B 2 T −1 , the TCM encoders [G[13,17] , B 2 ]
and [G[13,4] , N 2 ] are equivalent, where

are narrower than the regular Hadamard classes deﬁned in
[16], each including M reduced column echelon matrices.
There are thus MR modiﬁed Hadamard classes, each with
cardinality MT .
The problem of ﬁnding the set Rm of reduced column echelon matrices for a given m can be solved by using a modiﬁed
version of the full linear search algorithm introduced in [16,
Sec. VIII]. Such an algorithm would generate one member of
each modiﬁed Hadamard class, the one that corresponds to a
reduced column echelon matrix LR .

In this section we show how the classiﬁcation introduced
in this paper can be used to ﬁnd asymptotically optimal TCM
encoders in terms of FER. We use a union bound on the FER
that is a straightforward generalization of the bound presented
in [18] for convolutional codes. For the AWGN channel, and
a block length of K symbols, we obtain

In (11), Es is the average symbol energy, N0 /2 is the variance
of the noise, Ad is the distance multiplicity of the TCM system, which gives the average number of pairs of sequences at
ED d [19, eq. (6.9)] and D is the set of all EDs {d1 , d2 , d3 , . . .}
(di < di+1 ) between any two sequences5 of the TCM system,
where d1 is the minimum ED.
We call the inﬁnite set of pairs (d, Ad ) the distance spectrum
(DS) of a given TCM encoder Θ = [G, L], where d ∈ D. An
optimal DS TCM (ODSTCM) encoder is deﬁned in the same
way optimum distance spectrum convolutional encoders are
deﬁned in [20]. This means that to minimize the FER, the
DS (d, Ad ) must be sequentially optimized, i.e., ﬁrst d1 is
maximized, then Ad1 is minimized, then d2 maximized, etc.
We performed a search over G ∈ Gk,m,ν and L ∈ Lm

for k = 1 and 4PAM (m = 2 and sq = (2q − 5)/ 5). The
results are shown in Table II, where the ODSTCM encoders
are shown as [·, ·]∗ . For 4PAM, the possible squared EDs can
be expressed as d2 = d2 + 0.8(l − 1) for l = 2, 3, . . . In

for any TCM encoder Θ = [G, L], a new equivalent TCM
encoder can be generated using a convolutional encoder G =

GT −1 and a labeling L = LT −1 that belongs to the same

consequence of this result is that any TCM encoder using the
NBC labeling can be constructed using the BRGC and an
appropriately selected encoder.

IV. A PPLICATION : A SYMPTOTICALLY O PTIMAL TCM

Using Theorem 2, all the 24 binary labelings in L2 (cf. Table I)
can be generated by multiplying the matrices in R2 and in T2 .
As a consequence of Theorems 1 and 2, the two TCM
encoders [G, L] and [GT −1 , LR ] are equivalent for any
G ∈ Gk,m,ν and L ∈ Lm , where LR and T are given by
the factorization (7). In other words, all nonequivalent TCM
encoders can be generated using one member of each modiﬁed
Hadamard class only, and thus, a joint optimization over all
G ∈ Gk,m,ν and L ∈ Lm can be reduced to an optimization
over all G ∈ Gk,m,ν and L ∈ Rm with no loss in performance.
This means that the search space is reduced by a factor of
MT = M !/MR .

Theorem 3 can be understood as follows. Any TCM encoder using the NBC N m and a convolutional encoder G

The above relation between the NBC and the BRGC is

Theorem 3: The BRGC and the NBC of any order m
belong to the same modiﬁed Hadamard class.
Proof: The BRGC and NBC are related via B m =
N m T , with T given by (4). The theorem now follows from
Theorem 2 and the deﬁnition of a modiﬁed Hadamard class.

[8]

We analyzed the problem of jointly designing the convolutional encoder and the labeling of a TCM scheme, by grouping
the labelings into classes. Theoretically, this contributes to
a better understanding of the interplay between code and
labeling in TCM systems. Practically, it enables more powerful
optimization methods for TCM schemes. As a proof of concept, TCM schemes were found that improve on Ungerboeck’s
celebrated designs by up to 0.3 dB.

VI. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

[13]

The authors would like to thank Prof. Dr.-Ing. Robert
Fischer for pointing out the equivalence between TCM systems
with convolutional encoders optimized for the BRGC and the
NBC, and showing how the convolutional encoders in [10]
and [1] are related. These observations inspired this paper.

that in some cases there are multiple TCM encoders yielding the
same 5-term spectrum. In this case, the ﬁrst pair of labeling and convolutional
encoder (tested in a lexicographic order) is chosen.
