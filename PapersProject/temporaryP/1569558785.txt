Abstract—This paper is devoted to hyper-bent functions with
multiple trace terms (including binomial functions) via Dillon-like
exponents. We show how the approach developed by Mesnager to
extend the Charpin–Gong family, which was also used by Wang
et al. to obtain another similar extension, ﬁts in a much more
general setting.
To this end, we ﬁrst explain how the original restriction for
Charpin–Gong criterion can be weakened before generalizing
the Mesnager approach to arbitrary Dillon-like exponents. Afterward, we tackle the problem of devising inﬁnite families of
extension degrees for which a given exponent is valid and apply
these results not only to reprove straightforwardly the results of
Mesnager, and Wang et al., but also to characterize the hyperbentness of new inﬁnite classes of Boolean functions.
Index Terms—Boolean functions, hyper-bent functions, Walsh–
Hadamard transform, exponential sums, Dickson polynomials,
Dillon exponents.

where n = 2m is an even integer, R is a set of representatives
of the cyclotomic classes modulo 2m + 1, ar ∈ F2m , s divides
2m + 1, that is s(2m − 1) is a Dillon-like exponent, t is the
size of the cyclotomic coset of s modulo 2m + 1, and b ∈ F2t .
In Section II, we provide some background on the different
objects we use. Section III and IV build the core of this paper:
in the former one, we study general Dillon-like exponents; in
the latter one, we devise for which extension degrees a given
exponent is valid. Section V then provides both known and
new applications of the developed theory.

I. I NTRODUCTION

II. N OTATION AND PRELIMINARIES

Hyper-bent functions were deﬁned by Youssef and Gong [1]
in 2001 and are both of theoretical and practical interest. In
fact, they were initially proposed by Golomb and Gong [2] as
a component of S-boxes to ensure the security of symmetric
cryptosystems. But such functions are rare and, not only
their characterization, but also their generation are challenging
problems.
In 2008, Charpin and Gong [3] studied the hyper-bentness
of Boolean functions with multiple trace terms in the following
form:
m
fa (x) =
Trn ar xr(2 −1)
1

Throughout this paper, m ≥ 0 is a positive integer and
n = 2m is an even integer. The base ﬁeld for our work will be
F2m , but our ﬁnal motivation is the study of Boolean functions
deﬁned over F2n . The element α denotes a primitive element
of F2n . While working over ﬁnite ﬁelds, we use the shorthand
notation 1/0 = 0. For any set S such that 0 ∈ S, S ∗ denotes
S ∗ = S \ {0} and |S| denotes the cardinality of S.

A. Boolean functions and polynomial forms
Every non-zero Boolean function f deﬁned on F2n has a
trace expansion of the form

r∈R

where n = 2m is an even integer, R is a set of representatives
of the cyclotomic classes modulo 2m + 1 of full size n and
ar ∈ F2m . This class was extended by Mesnager [4], [5],
and later by Wang et al. [6]–[8], to include additional trace
n
−1
terms on F4 and on F16 with respective exponents 2 3 and
2n −1
5 . Both these approaches are quite similar and crucially
depend on the fact that the hypothesis made on the extension
degree implies that 3 and 5 do not only divide 2n − 1, but also
2m + 1. In this paper, we show how such approaches can be
extended to an inﬁnity of different trace terms, covering all
the possible Dillon-like exponents. In particular, we show that
they are valid for an inﬁnite number of other denominators,
e.g. 9 or 11. To this end, we consider a function of the general

j∈Γn

where Γn is a set of representatives of the cyclotomic classes
modulo 2n − 1, the coefﬁcients aj are in F2n , and = wt(f )
modulo 2. Such a representation can be made unique by
restricting the coefﬁcients aj to F2o(j) and by writing f as
o(j)

f (x) =

Tr1

n

aj xj + (1 + x2

j∈Γn

where o(j) is the size of the cyclotomic coset of j modulo
2n − 1. It is then called the polynomial form of f .

D ILLON - LIKE EXPONENTS : A GENERIC APPROACH

B. Walsh–Hadamard transform and bentness
The “sign” function of a Boolean function f is the integervalued function χf = χ (f ) = (−1)f , i.e. f composed with
the additive character of F2 .
The extended Walsh–Hadamard transform of f is deﬁned
as
n
k
(−1)f (x)+Tr1 (ωx ) ,
χ (ω, k) =

A. Extending the Charpin–Gong criterion
The family of Boolean functions Fn consists of the functions fa given by Dillon-like only exponents, that is

x∈F2n

Deﬁnition II.1. A Boolean function f on F2n is said to be
hyper-bent if its extended Walsh–Hadamard transform only
n
takes the values ±2 2 .

(1)

Lemma III.1. Let fa be a Boolean function in Fn . Then
m
fa (α2 +1 x) = fa (x).
In the following theorem, we express the complete extended
Walsh–Hadamard spectrum of fa with Λ(a) = Λ(fa ).

C. Dickson polynomials

Theorem III.2. Let fa be a Boolean function in Fn . For ω =
0,
χfa (0, k) = 1 + Λ(a) (−1 + 2m ) ,

Recall that the family of binary Dickson polynomials
Dr (x) ∈ F2 [x] is deﬁned by

i=0

−1)

where R is a set of representatives of the cyclotomic classes
modulo 2m + 1 and ar ∈ F2n . Departing from the approach
of Charpin and Gong, we do not require that the cyclotomic
cosets are of maximal size n = 2m.

for ω ∈ F2n and k an integer co-prime with 2n − 1. A hyperbent functions can be deﬁned as follows.

Dr (x) =

χfa (ω, k) = 1 − Λ(a) + 2m (−1)fa (ω

.

In particular, fa is hyper-bent if and only if Λ(a) = 1.

The reader can refer to the monograph of Lind, Mullen and
Turnwald [9] for many useful properties and applications of
Dickson polynomials. In particular, for any non-zero positive
integers r and s, Dickson polynomials satisfy

n
r
Remark III.3. Set f a (x) =
r∈R Tr1 (ar x ), and let
m
Λ(a) = Λ(f a ). The (2 − 1)-power map induces a permutation of U , so that Λ(a) = Λ(a).

1) deg(Dr (x)) = r,
2) Drs (x) = Dr (Ds (x)),
3) Dr (x + x−1 ) = xr + x−r .

We now restrict to the family Gn of Boolean functions
deﬁned as above, but with ar ∈ F2m . The following remark
shows that it is enough to restrict to Dillon-like exponents
whose cyclotomic coset sizes do not divide m.
m

D. Exponential sums

Remark III.4. If t = o(r(2m −1)), then Trn ar xr(2 −1) =
1
m
Trt Trn (ar ) xr(2 −1) . Suppose now that ar ∈ F2m , e.g.

and Trn ar xr(2 −1) = 0. Otherwise, if k = gcd(t, m), then

Trn (ar ) ∈ F2k .

Let f be a Boolean function on F2m . We denote the
exponential sum associated with f by Ξ(f ), that is
Ξ(f ) =

χf (x) .

Furthermore, Theorem III.2 can be used to compute the dual
of fa in the case where fa is hyper-bent.

x∈F2m

The following partial exponential sums are a classical tool
to study hyper-bentness.

Proposition III.5. Suppose that fa ∈ Gn is hyper-bent. Then
it is its own dual, i.e. we have χfa (ω) = 2m χfa (ω).

Deﬁnition II.2. Let f be a Boolean function on F2n and U
be the set of (2m + 1)-th roots of unity in F2n . We deﬁne Λ(f )
as
Λ(f ) =

Remark III.3 combined with the transitivity of the trace
yields a useful expression of Λ(a).
Lemma III.6 ( [5, Lemma 12]). Let fa ∈ Gn and ga be deﬁned
on F2m as ga (x) = r∈R Trm (ar Dr (x)). Then Λ(fa (xl )) =
1
1 + 2T1 (ga ◦ Dl ) for any l ≥ 0.

χf (u) .
u∈U

Deﬁnition II.3. Let f be a Boolean function on F2m . For
i ∈ F2 , let Ti denote the set Ti = {x ∈ F2m | Trm (1/x) = i},
1
and Ti (f ) the partial exponential sum
Ti (f ) =

It is then straightforward to prove the following extension
of the Charpin–Gong criterion [3, Theorem 7].
Theorem III.7. Let fa ∈ Gn and ga be deﬁned on F2m as
ga (x) = r∈R Trm (ar Dr (x)). Then fa is hyper-bent if and
1
only if T1 (ga ) = 0.

B. Extending the Mesnager criterion
The above approach yields criteria for hyper-bentness involving only one exponential sums over U ⊂ F2n or
T1 ⊂ F2m . In the latter case, the restriction that lies on the
coefﬁcients ar is not satisfactory. In this subsection, we extend
the approach of Mesnager to partially address this issue and
consider the family Hn of Boolean functions deﬁned as

We now devise an additional relation between S i and T1 .
Proposition III.13. Let l be a divisor of τ and let k be the
integer k = τ /l. Then

(2)

with R and ar ∈ F2m as before, s divides 2m +1, t = o(s(2m −

is a generator of U and ξ = ζ s is a generator of W ⊂ F∗t .

The set U can be decomposed as U = i=0 ζ i V .

One then concludes with Lemma III.6.
To conclude this section, further identities can be obtained
by restricting ar to a strict subﬁeld of F2m .

Deﬁnition III.9. For 0 ≤ i ≤ τ − 1, deﬁne S i (a) to be the
partial exponential sums

Moreover, deﬁne Λ(a, b) = Λ(fa,b ) and Λ(a, b) = Λ(f a,b ).
Remark III.10. The Boolean function fa,b is hyper-bent if
and only if Λ(a, b) = 1. Moreover, Remark III.3 can be
extended to fa,b and f a,b and yields Λ(a, b) = Λ(a, b). Finally,
Proposition III.5 can be extended to show that, if fa,b is hyperbent, then its dual is fa,b2m .

IV. B UILDING INFINITE FAMILIES OF EXTENSION DEGREES

C. Composite case

In the previous subsection, we set an extension degree m
and studied the corresponding exponents s. It is however
customary to go the opposite way around, i.e. set an exponent
and devise characterizations valid for an inﬁnity of extension
degrees. In this section, we provide the link between these two
approaches.

We conclude this section with the case of a product of at
least two different odd prime numbers for which the group
of units is not cyclic anymore. Nonetheless, the order of 2
modulo τ is the least common multiple of its orders modulo
the prime powers and there exists an integer i such that 2i ≡
−1 (mod τ ) if and only if they are even and share the same
2-adic valuation.

A. Prime number
V. A PPLICATIONS

Let ﬁrst τ = p be an odd prime number. There exists i such
that 2i ≡ −1 (mod p) if and only if the order of 2 modulo
p is even. In this case, taking m ≡ l (mod 2l), where 2l is
the order of 2 modulo p, yields an inﬁnite family of values
of m for which 2m ≡ −1 (mod p). The size t = o(s) of the
cyclotomic coset of s = (2m + 1)/p modulo 2m + 1, is then
t = 2l. Furthermore, one has 2m ≡ 2l (mod 2t − 1), so that
if fa,b ∈ Hn is hyper-bent, then its dual is fa,b2l .
To actually devise such prime numbers, we now focus on
the speciﬁc case where 2 is primitive. In this situation, the
above condition becomes
2

p−1
2

≡ −1

In this section, we show how the results of Section III can be
applied to several inﬁnite families of Boolean functions in order to obtain characterizations of their hyper-bentness in terms
of complete exponential sums. Much of these applications can
be straightforwardly extended to other cases.
A. The case b = 1
We begin with the speciﬁc case where b = 1. In particular,
there exists β ∈ F2m such that Trn (β) = 1 and fa,1 belongs
t
to both families Gn and Hn . Applying Theorem III.7 shows
that fa,1 is hyper-bent if and only if

(mod p) .
Trm (ar Dr (t)) + Trm (βDs (t))
1

χ

For such a prime number p, taking m ≡ p−1 (mod p − 1)
2
yields an inﬁnite family of values of m for which 2m ≡ −1
(mod p), the corresponding denominator being τ = p. The
size t = o(s) of the cyclotomic coset of s = (2m + 1)/p
modulo 2m + 1, is then t = p − 1.
Finding an inﬁnite number of odd prime numbers for which
2 is primitive would thus give an elegant solution to our
problem, i.e. ﬁnding an inﬁnite family of denominators τ
associated with inﬁnite families of extension degrees m. This
problem is a special case of Artin’s conjecture on primitive
roots. It has been proved by Hooley [10] under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Heath-Brown [11] has proved
unconditionally that there exist at most two exceptional primes
for which it fails; nonetheless, this proof is non-constructive.
Anyhow, the sequence of such primes is sequence A001122
in OEIS [12] and begins with

t∈T1

=0 .

r∈R

The results of Subsection III-B give a different characterization. Let ξ be a primitive τ -th root of unity. First, ξ lies in
τ −1
F2t , so that i=0 ξ i = 0. Second, remark that the results of
Section IV imply that t is even, so that Trt (1) = 0. Moreover,
1
ξ is a (2t/2 + 1)-th root of unity so that ξ + ξ −1 ∈ F2t/2 which
implies that Trt ξ i = Trt ξ −i . Nonetheless, the trace of
1
1
ξ i for i = 0 depends on the exact value of τ .
For simplicity, we suppose that τ = pk is a prime power
and that 2 is primitive. Then t = φ(pk ). Let i = lpe with l
co-prime with p − 1 and 0 ≤ e ≤ k − 1 so that

B. Prime power case
The extension of the above treatment to the case where
τ = pk is a prime power with k ≥ 2 is straightforward. The
group of units modulo pk is indeed cyclic, so that the condition
for the prime case is thus still valid. Moreover, if a is primitive
φ(pk )
modulo p2 , then it is modulo pk for any k ≥ 2 and 2 2 ≡
−1 (mod φ(pk )) where φ denotes Euler’s totient function.
In practice, more can be said. Indeed, if 2 is primitive
modulo p, but is not modulo p2 , then 2p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p2 ),
that is p is a Wieferich prime. Only two of them are currently
known: 1093 and 3511; and 2 is not primitive modulo both
of these primes. Checking that 2 is primitive modulo p is
therefore enough to ensure that it is modulo any power of p
as long as p is less than ﬁfteen decimal digits [13].

The ﬁrst two sums of the right hand side of the last equality
are zero. If 0 ≤ e ≤ k − 2, then the third sum is zero as well,
and if e = k − 1, then it is one. Proposition III.12 ﬁnally reads

The family we considered above actually contain hyper-bent
functions. For example, fa,b is hyper-bent when:

• τ = 11, m = 15, R = {1, 3}, a1 = x

and b = 1;
the ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m being represented as F2 [x]/(Cm (x)) where
Cm (x) is the m-th Conway polynomial.

pk Λ(a, 1) = 4T1 (ga ◦ Dpk )) − 4pT1 (ga ◦ Dpk−1 )
+ 2pk T1 (ga ) + pk − 2p + 2 .
In particular, fa,1 is hyper-bent if and only if
p − 1 = 2T1 (ga ◦ Dpk ) − 2pT1 (ga ◦ Dpk−1 ) + pk T1 (ga ) .
B. Explicit values for τ
The previous subsection dealt with a ﬁxed value of b ∈ F∗t
2
casting as few restrictions as possible on τ . We now treat the
ﬁrst few possible values of τ for all values of b with as few
restrictions as possible on the coefﬁcients ar .
The ﬁrst value for τ = 3 was addressed by Mesnager [5] in
2010. The second one τ = 5 was addressed by Wang et al. [6]
in late 2011. Their results can be straightforwardly deduced
from the above theory. For τ = 7, the order of 2 is odd.
In the case τ = 9, t = 6 and m ≡ 3 (mod 6). Moreover, if
the coefﬁcients ar lie in F2l , where l = m/3, then 2l is −1,
2 or −4 modulo 9 when l is respectively 0, 1 and 2 modulo
3. In the last two cases, Proposition III.14 tells that

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have extended previous characterizations
of hyper-bentness by Charpin and Gong, Mesnager, and Wang
et al., to much wider classes of Boolean functions, giving as
well more insight on the tools and restrictions involved in these
approaches. A challenging question is to prove that speciﬁc
families of Boolean functions considered in this paper, that
is restricted to a given set of indices R, contain an inﬁnite
number of hyper-bent functions. The case of monomial functions with the Dillon exponent is a much celebrated theorem
of Lachaud and Wolfmann [14, Theorem 3.4]. The case of
binomial functions with the Dillon exponent and an additional
trace term over F4 has been treated by Mesnager [4], that of
binomial functions with the Dillon exponent and an additional
trace term over F16 has been treated by Wang et al. [7], [8].

S 1 (a) = S 2 (a) = S 4 (a) .
Propositions III.12 and III.13 and explicit computations
of the traces Tr6 bξ i yield the following characterizations

6T1 (ga ) + 1.

To conclude this subsection, we give the only result for
τ = 11 which is valid without restriction on the coefﬁcients
ar ∈ F2m , apart from the case b = 1 included above.
Theorem V.3. Let τ = 11 and m ≡ 5 (mod 10). If mb (x) =
x2 + x + 1, x10 + x9 + x8 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, x10 + x9 + x8 +
x4 + x3 + x2 + 1, or x10 + x9 + x8 + x6 + x5 + x + 1, then
11Λ(a, b) = −2T1 (ga ◦ D11 ) − 1.
