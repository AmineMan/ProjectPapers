equal to the set of permutation matrices. It implies that we
can apply techniques of LP for decoding if G is the set of
permutation matrices. For generalizing this approach, it would
be meaningful to ﬁnd a method that yields linear constraints
with no fractional points, called ML-certiﬁcate constraints.
In this paper, we present a novel technique to construct linear constraints that have no fractional vertices by introducing
a structure called “consolidation”. This technique allows us to
focus the discussions on code size, encoding algorithms and
decoding algorithms to local structures. Furthermore, we show
an application of this technique to ﬁnd a new compact graph.

Abstract—Linear constraints for a matrix polytope with no
fractional vertex are investigated as intersecting research among
permutation codes, rank modulations, and linear programming
methods. By focusing the discussion to the block structures of
matrices, new classes of such polytopes are obtained from known
small polytopes and give ML decodable codes by an LP method.
This concept “consolidation” is applied to ﬁnd a new compact
graph which is known as an approach for the graph isomorphism
problem. The minimum distances associated with Kendall tau and
Euclidean distances of a code obtained by changing the basis of
a permutation code may be larger than the original one.

I. I NTRODUCTION

As is mentioned in introduction, we deﬁne a permutation
code (G, μ) from a set G of permutation matrices and a vector
μ. Our argument in this paper will not rely on a choice of μ.
Thus we focus the explanation on which G is obtained by our
construction.
Throughout this paper Xi,j denotes the (i, j)th entry of a
matrix X. The index of matrices and vectors will start with
not 1 but 0; for example, (v0 , v1 , v2 ). The set of real numbers
will be denoted by R and the set of n-by-n matrices over R
shall be denoted by Mn (R).
As our contribution, we obtain permutation codes that are
decodable by using an LP method, have no fractional vertex,
and are constructed from techniques of this paper.

Permutation codes have been proposed for the purpose of
digital modulation schemes [1]. Formally speaking, a permutation code (G, μ) is the orbit {Xμ | X ∈ G}, where G is
a set of permutation matrices1 and μ is a Euclidean vector.
The main goal of permutation code is, “for a given Euclidean
vector λ, to ﬁnd an orbit Xμ which minimizes a distance
||λ − Xμ|| over X ∈ G by an efﬁcient algorithm.”
In recent years, study of permutation codes has been one
of the most exciting topics in coding theory. In 2008, Jiang
et.al. discovered a remarkable application of permutation code
for ﬂash memory coding [2]. In 2010, Barg investigated permutation codes and their error-correction for rank modulation
[3]. Papandreou et.al., reported implementation of permutation
codes as drift-tolerant multilevel phase-change memory [4].
Wadayama discovered a new approach for error-correction
of permutation codes by using a linear programing (LP)
method [5]. The following problem is considered “maximize
λT Xμ, for ﬁxed Euclidean vectors μ, λ where X is taken
over the Birkhoff polytope2 .” It is shown that if a matrix
X0 maximizes the problem above, then X0 minimizes the
Euclidean distance ||λ − Xμ|| where X is again taken over
the polytope. The set of vertices of the Birkhoff polytope is

A. Wreath Product
We embed the permutation group SR on {0, 1, . . . , R − 1}
into the set MR (R) of matrices by the following manner: for
a permutation σ in SR , we deﬁne an R-by-R matrix X σ by
σ
Xi,j := δj=σ(i) , where δ is the Kronecker delta.
For ν-by-ν matrices g0 , g1 , . . . , gR−1 and σ ∈ SR , we deﬁne
a (νR)-by-(νR) permutation matrix X := (Xij ) as
Xij :=

1 In some references, G is chosen as a generalized permutation group, e.g.,
a signed permutation group.

the collection of matrices (σ|g0 , g1 , . . . , gR−1 ) is said to be a

a matrix. Formally speaking, by regarding an entry Xi,j as a
variable (0 ≤ i, j < n), we state either
l(X) :

ci,j Xi,j ≥ c0 ,

ci,j Xi,j = c0 , or l(X) :
0≤i,j<n

0≤i,j<n

for some c0 , ci,j ∈ R. If we need not clarify the variable X
of a linear constant l(X), we denote it simply by l.
Note III.1. Let us deﬁne three kinds of constraints:
• (row-sum constraints)
0≤j<n Xi0 ,j = 1,
• (column-sum constraints)
0≤i<n Xi,j0 = 1,
• (positivity) Xi0 ,j0 ≥ 0,

matrix X. LD denotes a set of linear constrains, deﬁned as

B. ML-Certiﬁcate LP-Decodable Permutation Codes
Let Cn denote a cyclic group of order n, D2n a dihedral
group of order 2n, and Sn a symmetric group of order n!. We
consider the groups Cn , D2n and Sn are sets of permutation
matrices of size n-by-n.
Let ν and R be positive integers such that ν = 2, 4 and
R ≥ 2. Deﬁne n := νR. For each 0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1, deﬁne
Gr as one of Cν , D2ν , and Sν , and deﬁne GR as one of
CR , D2R , and SR . Then we can construct the following set G
of νR-by-νR permutation matrices for a permutation code as
G := {(gR |g0 , g1 , . . . , gR−1 ) | gr ∈ Gr , 0 ≤ r ≤ R}.
Let c, d and s denote the number of times Cν , D2ν , and
Sν that are chosen for Gr (0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1) respectively.
Similarly, deﬁne cR , dR and sR to be the number of CR , D2R ,
and SR that are chosen for GR respectively. Hence only one
of cR , dR , sR is 1 and the others are 0. By using this notation,
the cardinality of G is ν c (2ν)d (ν!)s RcR (2R)dR (R!)sR .
Previously known examples [6], [7] are associated with the
choices (c, d, s, cR , dR , sR ) = (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1).
Next let ν := 2 and n := 2R. For each 0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1,
let us choose Gr again from C2 and the unit group, i.e., the
group consists of only the identity matrix.
Let c and u denote the number of times C2 ’s and the unit
groups that are chosen for Gr (0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1) respectively.
Similarly, deﬁne a set G and deﬁne cR , dR and sR . Hence
only one of cR , dR , sR is 1 and the others are 0. By using
this notation, the cardinality of G is 2c RcR (2R)dR (R!)sR . For
“c = R and sR = 1”, G becomes a group and is isomorphic to
a signed permutation group “as a group” whose permutation
code has been investigated in [1], [8].
Next, let ν := 4 and n := 4R. Let P4 denote the set of
permutations, which are known as pure involutions in S4 [5].
Then P4 consists of three elements.
For each 0 ≤ r ≤ R − 1, let us choose Gr again from
C4 , D8 , S4 and P4 . Let c, d, s and p denote the number
of times C4 , D8 , S4 and P4 that are chosen for Gr (0 ≤
r ≤ R − 1) respectively. Similarly, deﬁne a set G and deﬁne
cR , dR and sR . Hence only one of cR , dR , sR is 1 and the
others are 0. By using this notation, the cardinality of G is
4c 8d 24s 3p RcR (2R)dR (R!)sR .

LD

:=

{row-sum constraints}
∪{column-sum constraints} ∪ {positivity}.

For clarifying the size n, we may denote LD by LD(n) .
Let L be a set of linear constraints. For a constant l ∈ L
and a matrix X, if X satisﬁes l, we write X |= l. If X |= l
for every l ∈ L, we write X |= L. A doubly stochastic
constraint L for an n-by-n matrix is deﬁned as a set of linear
constraints such that X |= L implies X |= LD . In particular,
the constraints LD is a doubly stochastic constraint.
The collection of n-by-n matrices which satisfy all of linear
constraints in a doubly stochastic constraint L is denoted by
Dn [L]. We call Dn [L] a doubly stochastic polytope for L.
Since X σ |= LD , we have Sn ⊂ Dn [LD ]. Note that any
doubly stochastic polytope is a subset of Dn [LD ]. For D ⊂
Mn (R), D is simply said to be a doubly stochastic polytope
if there exists a doubly stochastic constraint L such that D =
Dn [L].
Let D be a doubly stochastic polytope. An element X ∈ D
is called a vertex if there are neither elements X0 , X1 ∈ D
with X0 = X1 nor positive numbers c0 , c1 such that X =
c0 X0 + c1 X1 . We denote the set of vertices for D by Ver(D).
A permutation code (G, μ) is called an LP (Linear
Programming)-decodable permutation code if there exists
L such that G = GL , where GL := Ver(Dn [L]) ∩ Sn . The
following is an error-correcting decoding algorithm for LPdecodable permutation codes.
Deﬁnition III.2 (Error-Correcting Decoding Algorithm [5]).
Input: vectors μ, λ, and a doubly stochastic constraint L.
Output: a vector μ0 .
1. Solve the following linear programming problem:
maximizeλT Xμ subject to X |= L,
2. Deﬁne μ0 := X0 μ, for a solution X0 .
3. Output μ0 .

III. C OMPACTNESS

It is important to remark that a solution is in Ver(Dn [L])
if the solution exists uniquely. Therefore we prefer a doubly
stochastic constraint L such that Ver(Dn [L]) ⊂ Sn for a
permutation code (GL , μ).

A. Compact Constraints
A linear constraint l(X) for an n-by-n matrix is deﬁned
as either a linear equation or a linear inequality on entries of

A doubly stochastic constraint L for an n-by-n matrix is
called a compact constraint if
• L consists of a ﬁnite number of linear constraints,
• the doubly stochastic polytope Dn [L] is a bounded set,
• the vertex set satisﬁes Ver(Dn [L]) ⊂ Sn .
By the following theorem, the doubly stochastic constraint
LD is compact.

identity matrix and AΓ is the adjacency matrix for Γ. We call
Γ(R) a union of R-Γs. Since Γ(R) is not connected, it is not
a seed graph for R ≥ 2.
One of our main contributions is the following:
Theorem III.4. Let Γ be a seed graph and R a positive
integer. A union Γ(R) is compact if and only if Γ is compact.

Theorem).

Proof is given in IV-B using a “consolidation” technique.
When Γ is “un-directed and R = 2,” Theorem III.4 is the
same as Tinhofer’s theorem [7].

Our primary interest is to ﬁnd a new class of compact
constraints. To the best of the author’s knowledge, not many
compact constraints have been found yet.

C. Examples of Compact Graphs
For a permutation σ and a graph Γ, we deﬁne a graph σ(Γ)
as a graph associated with an adjacency matrix X σ AΓ (X σ )−1 ,
where X σ is the permutation matrix associated with σ and AΓ
is the adjacency matrix of Γ. A permutation σ is called an automorphism for Γ if σ(Γ) = Γ holds, i.e., X σ AΓ (X σ )−1 =
AΓ . Let Aut(Γ) denote the set of automorphisms for Γ. It
is easy to verify that X ∈ Aut(Γ) ⇐⇒ XAΓ = AΓ X
for a permutation matrix X. Therefore Dn [LΓ ] ⊃ Aut(Γ)
holds. By this inclusion and Birkhoff von-Neumann theorem,
we have Ver(Dn [LΓ ]) ⊃ Aut(Γ) for any graph Γ. Hence
Ver(Dn [LΓ ]) = Aut(Γ) if and only if LΓ is compact.

B. Compact Graph
The notion of compact graph has been introduced for the
study of the graph isomorphism problem, a famous problem
in computer science. Even though the motivation of the study
of compact graphs seems far from error-correcting codes, we
apply it to permutation codes.
Let Γ := ({0, 1, . . . , ν −1}, E) be a graph with its vertex set
{0, 1, . . . ν −1} and its edge set E, i.e., E ⊂ {0, 1, . . . , ν −1}2 .
Note that, in this paper, Γ is allowed to be an undirected graph.
Let AΓ be the adjacency matrix of Γ, i.e., AΓ ∈ Mν (R) and
its (i, j)-entry AΓ is
i,j
AΓ :=
i,j

1 if (i, j) ∈ E,
0 o.w.

For a graph Γ, we deﬁne a graph constraint LΓ as LΓ :=
LD ∪ {XAΓ = AΓ X}. Note that XAΓ = AΓ X deﬁnes ν 2 linear equations by regarding each entry as an equation. A
graph Γ is called compact if LΓ is compact.

Graph of Type Cycle

Schreck showed “a compact regular graph with prime
vertices must be a circulant graph” in [9]. Hence, it is not
easy to design various compact graphs. On the other hand,
Tinhofer showed “any connected tree and any cycle are compact graphs” in [6] and “a union of the same two connected
un-directed graph is compact” in [7].
Example III.5 (Line and Televis3 ). Let E := {(i, j) | i − j =
±1}. Since Γ := ({0, 1, . . . , ν−1}, E) is a tree, Γ is a compact
seed graph. If ν = 2, we call the graph a televis. Aut(Γ) is
isomorphic to a cyclic group C2 .

Fig. 1. DSM and Dn [LΓ ]: we like to avoid fractional vertices due to the
additional equations XAΓ = AΓ X.

Example III.6 (Circle). Let E := {(i, j) | i − j = ±1
(mod ν)}. Then Γ := ({0, 1, . . . , ν − 1}, E) is a compact
seed graph and Aut(Γ) is isomorphic to a dihedral group
D2ν 4 , and is known as a reﬂection group of type Iν [10].

For a graph Γ = (V, E) and its vertex v ∈ V , the cardinality
#{i ∈ V | (i, v) ∈ E} (resp. #{j ∈ V | (v, j) ∈ E}) is called
in-degree (resp. out-degree) of v. We call Γ a seed graph if Γ
is connected and the in-degree of v is equal to the out-degree
of v for any vertex v of Γ.
For a graph Γ = ({0, 1, . . . , ν − 1}, E) and a positive integer R, we deﬁne a graph Γ(R) with a vertex set

as compact graphs but they are.

The aim of this section is to introduce a new technique
“consolidation” to construct a compact constraint.

Let l be a linear constraint for an n-by-n matrix. We call l
homogeneous if the constant term of l is 0. Formally speaking,
l(X) : 0≤i,j<n ci,j Xi,j = 0, or l(X) : 0≤i,j<n ci,j Xi,j ≥
0, for some ci,j ∈ R. For examples, the “positivity” is
homogeneous but the “row-sum constraint” is not. The following weak constraints are homogeneous too: we call the
following n-linear constraints weak row-sum constraints:
0≤j<n Xi0 ,j =
0≤j<n X0,j , for any 0 ≤ i0 < n. Weak
column-sum constraints are similarly deﬁned.
A set L of linear constraints is said to be a quasihomogeneous constraint if L consists of homogeneous constraints, row-sum constraints and column-sum constraints.
For example, LD and any graph constraint are quasihomogeneous.
For a quasi-homogeneous constraint L, we construct a homogeneous constraint L by replacing all row-sum (resp. all
column-sum) constraints in L with weak row-sum constraints
(resp. column-sum). We call L a merged constraint for L.
Let us divide a νR-by-νR matrix X into R2 block ma[r ,r ]
trices X [r0 ,r1 ] of size ν-by-ν via the relation: Xi,j0 1 =
Xr0 ν+i,r1 ν+j , for 0 ≤ i, j < ν and 0 ≤ r0 , r1 < R. For
example, if ν = 3 and R = 2, we have

B. Consolidation
Let M[r0 ,r1 ] be a quasi-homogeneous constraint for a νby-ν matrix for 0 ≤ r0 , r1 < R. Let H be a set of linear
constraints for an R-by-R matrix. For {M[r0 ,r1 ] } and H, we
deﬁne a linear constraint M H for a νR-by-νR matrix as
M H := {m[r0 ,r1 ] (X [r0 ,r1 ] ) | m[r0 ,r1 ] ∈ M[r0 ,r1 ] , 0 ≤
r0 , r1 < R} ∪ {h# | h ∈ H}, where X is a νR-by-νR matrix
and X [r0 ,r1 ] is the (r0 , r1 )th block of X of size ν-by-ν. We
call M H a consolidation for {M[r0 ,r1 ] } and H. One of

We call X [r0 ,r1 ] the (r0 , r1 ) block of X.
Let H be a set of linear constraints for an R-by-R matrix.
For h(H) ∈ H, we deﬁne a linear constraint h# (X) for a

νR-by-νR matrix by replacing Hr0 ,r1 with 0≤j<ν X0,j 1 .
For H, we deﬁne H# := {h# | h ∈ H} and call it a holding
constraint of degree ν. For example: let H := {h1 (H) :
H00 + H01 = 1, h2 (H) : H00 + H10 = 1, h3 (H) : H11 ≥ 0}.

Lemma IV.2. Let Γ be a compact seed graph with ν-vertices
and LD(R) a doubly stochastic constraint in Note III.1, for
an R-by-R matrix. Let MΓ be a set {M[r0 ,r1 ] } of quasihomogeneous constrains, where M[r0 ,r1 ] := LΓ .
Then we have DνR [LΓ(R) ] = DνR [MΓ LD(R) ].

Let us show that X ∈ D[MΓ

D[LΓ(R) ]. Note that MΓ LD(R) \ LΓ(R) consists of weak
row-sum and weak column-sum constraints. We can verify
that Γ is a seed graph and X ∈ D[LΓ(R) ] satisﬁes weak

C. Distance Enlargement
The following is directly obtained from deﬁnitions.
Theorem V.2. Let Γ be a graph and and P σ a permutation
matrix associated with a permutation σ. Then we have
Dn [Lσ(Γ) ] = {P σ X(P σ )−1 | X ∈ Dn [LΓ ]},

Examples of compact quasi-homogeneous constraints in
III-A and III-C except for trees, have (reasonably) small computational cost encoding algorithms for the matrix sizes. For
LD in Note III.1 for an n-by-n matrix, an encoding algorithm
with computational cost O(n log n) is known (Sec.5.1 of [12]).
Our idea is to assume M[i,j] = M[i,0] and to reduce the discussion to a local encoder Enci : {0, 1, . . . , vi −1} → GM[i,0] ,
for 0 ≤ i, j < R and an encoder EncR : {0, 1, . . . , vR − 1} →
GH . A decoder is obtained in a similar manner.

Ver(Dn [Lσ(Γ) ]) = {P σ X(P σ )−1 | X ∈ Ver(Dn [LΓ ])}
where LΓ is a graph constraint for Γ. Hence σ(Γ) is compact
if and only if Γ is compact.
Let G be a permutation group. The minimum Euclidean
distance dE (G) motivated by the previous researches e.g., [5],
is deﬁned as dE (G) := ming0 ,g1 ∈G,g0 =g1 ||g0 μ − g1 μ||2 /2,
where μ = (1, 2, . . . , n) ∈ Rn . The minimum Kendall tau
distance dK (G), motivated by rank modulation researches
e.g., [3], is deﬁned as dK (G) := ming0 ,g1 ∈G,g0 =g1 #{(i, j) |
−1
−1
0 ≤ i < j < n, g0 g1 (i) > g0 g1 (j)}. In general,
dK (GΓ ) = dK (GΓ(R) ) and dE (GΓ ) = dE (GΓ(R) ) hold.
However, we may enlarge the distances.
Here is an example. Let Γ be a televis and σ is a permutation
on {0, 1, 2, 3} deﬁned as σ(0) := 0, σ(1) := 2, σ(2) :=
1, and σ(3) := 3. By routine calculation, we can verify
dK (GΓ(2) ) = 1 < dK (Gσ(Γ(2) ) ) = 2, and dE (GΓ(2) ) =
1 < dE (Gσ(Γ(2) ) ) = 2. Characterizing which permutation σ
maximizes these distances is interesting but not easy. We leave
this problem open to investigation.

Set mesi := mes (mod v0 v1 . . . vR−1−i ).
Update mes := (mes − mesi ) div vi .
Encode mesi to a permutation gi by Enci .
Update i := i + 1.
If i = R + 1 then go to 7. Else go to 2.
Output μ := (gR |g0 , g1 , . . . , gR−1 )μ.

B. Number of Linear Constraints

R EFERENCES

An additional equation XAΓ = AΓ X may decrease the
computational cost for error-correction. Here we present an
example with a graph Γ of type televis (see Example III.5).
[r0 ,r ]
[r0 ,r ]
Let us regard a linear constraint X0,0 1 − X1,1 1 = 0 as
[r0 ,r1 ]
[r0 ,r1 ]
[r0 ,r1 ]
[r ,r ]
substitution X0,0
= X1,1 . Let Y0
(resp. Y1 0 1 )
[r0 ,r ]
[r0 ,r ]
[r0 ,r ]
[r0 ,r ]
denote X0,0 1 and X1,1 1 (resp. X0,1 1 and X1,0 1 ).

Then the number of variables are reduced from 4R to 2R2 .
Furthermore, the linear constraint LΓ(R) is converted to a
doubly stochastic matrix LΓ(R) :

Totally, there are only 2R2 + 2R linear constraints. Remember
that LΓ(R) ⊃ LD(2R) . However, we have #LΓ(R) < #LD(2R) ,
since LD(2R) consists of 4R2 + 4R constraints. In this case
with a union of televis, an LP problem for error-correction is
