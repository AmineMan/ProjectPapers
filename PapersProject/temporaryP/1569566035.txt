Cooperative communication helps overcome fading and attenuation in wireless networks. Its main purpose is to increase
the communication rates across the network and to increase
reliability of time-varying links. It is known that wireless
communication from a source to a destination can beneﬁt from
the cooperation of nodes that overhear the transmission. The
classical single relay channel [1] exempliﬁes this situation.
Further work on the relay channel in [2] and [3] has enabled
substantial performance improvement.
However, there is evidence that additional gains can be
achieved with “network-layer” cooperation (or packet-level
cooperation), that is plain relaying without any physical layer
considerations [4] and [5]. In this work, we focus on this type
of cooperation. The work in [6] investigated the network-level
cooperation in a network consisting of a source and a relay
by considering the cases of full or no cooperation at the relay.
A key difference between physical-layer and network-layer
cooperation ideas is that the objective rate function that is
maximized is the so-called stable throughput region which
captures the bursty nature of trafﬁc from the source. In [6],
it was shown that the stability region of full cooperation
under random-access does not always strictly contain the noncooperative stability region.
The main contribution in this paper is to introduce the
notion of partial network-level cooperation by adding a ﬂow
controller for the trafﬁc coming to the relay from the source.
We prove that the system is always better than or at least
equal to the system without the ﬂow controller. Speciﬁcally,
we provide an exact characterization of the stability region of a
network consisting of a source, a relay and a destination node
as shown in Fig. 1. We consider the collision channel with
erasures and random access of the medium. The source and

the relay node have external arrivals; furthermore, the relay is
forwarding part of the source node’s trafﬁc to the destination.
Unlike the work in [6], the relay node is equipped with a ﬂow
controller that regulates the internal arrivals from the source
based on the conditions in the network to ensure the stability
of the queues. We characterize the stable throughput region
under conditions of no cooperation at all, full cooperation,
and probabilistic (opportunistic) cooperation. By probabilistic
cooperation we mean that under certain conditions in the
network, the relay may accept a packet from the source.
The characterization of the stability regions is known to be
challenging because the queues of the users are coupled (i.e.,
the service process of a queue depends on the status of
the other queues). A tool that bypasses this difﬁculty is the
stochastic dominance technique [7].
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a time-slotted system in which the nodes are
randomly accessing a common receiver as shown in Fig. 1.
We denote with S, R, and D the source, the relay and the
destination, respectively. Packet trafﬁc originates from S and
R. Because of the wireless broadcast nature, R may receive
some of the packets transmitted from S and then relay those
packets to D. The packets from S which failed to be received
by D but were successfully received by R are relayed by
R. As we impose half-duplex constraint, R can overhear S
only when it is idle. Each node has an inﬁnite size buffer for
storing incoming packets, and the transmission of each packet
occupies one time slot. Node R has separate queues for the
exogenous arrivals and the endogenous arrivals that are relayed
through R. But, we can let R to maintain a single queue and
merge all the arrivals into a single queue as the achievable
stable throughput region is not affected [6]. This is because

the link quality between R and D is independent of which
packet is selected for transmission.
The packet arrival processes at S and R are assumed
to be Bernoulli with rates λ1 and λ2 , respectively, and are
independent of each other. Node R is equipped with a ﬂow
controller that regulates the rate of endogenous arrivals from S
by randomly accepting the incoming packets with probability
pa ; that is, it controls the amount of cooperation that it is
willing to provide. In each time slot, nodes S and R attempt
to transmit with probabilities q1 and q2 , respectively, if their
queues are not empty. Decisions on transmission are made
independently among the nodes. We assumed collision channel
with erasures in which, if both S and R transmit in the
same time slot, a collision occurs and both transmissions
fail. The probability that a packet transmitted by node i is
successfully decoded at node j(̸= i) is denoted by pij which
is the probability that the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over the
speciﬁed link exceeds a certain threshold for the successful
decoding. These erasure probabilities capture the effect of
random fading at the physical layer. The probabilities p13 , p23 ,
and p12 denote the success probabilities over the link S − R,
R − D, and S − R, respectively. Node R has a better channel
to D than S, that is p23 > p13 .
The cooperation is performed at the protocol level as
follows. When S transmits a packet, if D decodes the packet
successfully, it sends an ACK and the packet exits the network;
if D fails to decode the packet but R does and the ﬂow
controller decides to relay the packet, then R sends an ACK
and takes over the responsibility of delivering the packet to D
by placing it in its queue. If neither D nor R decode (or if
R does not store the packet), the packet remains in S’s queue
for retransmission. The ACKs are assumed to be error-free,
instantaneous and broadcasted to all relevant nodes.
Denote by Qt the length of queue i at the beginning of time

slot t. Based on the deﬁnition in [8], the queue is said to be
stable if

III. M AIN R ESULTS
This section describes the stability region for the system
presented in the previous section and depicted in Fig. 1.
The relay node R is equipped with a ﬂow controller, and
the parameter pa of the ﬂow controller is the probability to
accept for the received packet from the source S. So, our
objective is to ﬁnd the optimum value of pa denoted by p∗
a
which maximizes the stability region. This value reﬂects the
cooperation degree that maximizes the stability region.
Theorem 3.1: The stability region of the opportunistic cooperative network depicted in Fig. 1 is described by:
∪
R = R1 R2
(6)
The subregion R1 is described as follows:
p23
– if q1 < p13 +p23 , then p∗ = 1 and the region is given
a
by Eq.(1).
p23
– if q1 ≥ p13 +p23 , then p∗ = 0 and the region is given
a
by Eq.(2).
• The subregion R2 is described as follows:
p13
– if q2 ≥ p13 +p23 , then p∗ = 1 and the region is given
a
by Eq.(3).
p13
– if q2 < p13 +p23 , then the subregion R2 is R2 =

R2 R2 where:
∗ if λ1 < q1 (1 − q2 )p13 , then p∗ = 0 and the region

λ1 −q1 (1−q2 )p13
and the region is given
q1 (1−q2 )(1−p13 )p12
by Eq.(5).
Proof: The proof is given in Section IV.
As seen in the theorem, there are three possible optimal values of pa . When p∗ equals to 0 or 1, the relay rejects or accepts
a
all the incoming trafﬁc from the source, respectively. The more
p13
interesting case is when q2 < p13 +p23 (the relay transmission
probability is less than a threshold which is a function of the
channel success probabilities) and at the same time the average
arrival rate at the source is λ1 ≥ q1 (1−q2 )p13 ; in this case the
optimum cooperation strategy is probabilistic routing by the
relay. The incoming trafﬁc from the source is relayed in part,

Loynes’ theorem [9] states that if the arrival and service
processes of a queue are strictly jointly stationary and the
average arrival rate is less than the average service rate, then
the queue is stable. If the average arrival rate is greater than
the average service rate, then the queue is unstable and the

some will exit the network because they are decoded by the

The intuition behind this result is that when the relay is not
attempting to transmit “very often” and at the same time, the
arrival rate at the source is greater than a certain value, then
the relay is cooperating only partially. Thus, p∗ controls the
a
amount of cooperation.

The conditional probability that a transmitted packet from
S (dummy packets excluded) arrives at R given that the
transmitted packet exits node S’s queue is given by:

The expressions for the average service rates seen by source
S and relay R are given by:

Pr(SB |SA ) =

µ1 = {(1 − q2 )Pr(Q2 ̸= 0) + Pr(Q2 = 0)}

(12)

The total arrival rate at the relay node is:

By Loyne’s Theorem, the stability condition for queue 2 at
node R is given by λQ2 < µQ2 and, thus:

Since the average service rate of each queue µ1 and µ2
depends on the queue size of the other queue, they cannot be
computed directly. We bypass this difﬁculty by utilizing the
idea of stochastic dominance [7]; that is, we ﬁrst construct
hypothetical dominant systems, in which one of the nodes
transmits dummy packets even when its packet queue is empty.
Since the queue sizes in the dominant system are, at all times,
at least as large as those of the original system, the stability
region of the dominant system inner-bounds that of the original
system. It turns out, however, that the stability region obtained
using this stochastic dominance technique coincides with that
of the original system which will be discussed in detail later
in this section. Thus, the stability regions for both the original
and the dominant systems are the same.

The probability that the queue is not empty can be computed
by Little’s theorem and is given by:

Thus, after substituting Eq.(15) into Eq.(7), the average service

(1 − q1 )p23

A. The ﬁrst dominant system: source node transmits dummy
packets
In this sub-section we obtain the region R1 of Theorem 3.1.
We consider the ﬁrst dominant system, in which node S
transmits dummy packets with probability q1 whenever its
queue is empty, while node R behaves in the same way as in
the original system. All other assumptions remain unaltered in
the dominant system. Thus, the service rate at the relay node
is given by:
µQ2 = q2 (1 − q1 ) p23
(9)

The stability condition for queue 1 at the source node is λ1 <
µ1 , and after some algebra, we obtain:

]

1+
λ1 +
λ2
(1 − q1 )p23
(1 − q1 )p23
< q1 [(1 − p13 )p12 pa + p13 ] (17)
An important observation made in [7] is that the stability
conditions obtained by using the stochastic dominance technique are not merely sufﬁcient conditions for the stability of
the original system but are sufﬁcient and necessary conditions.
The indistinguishability argument applies to our problem as
well. Based on the construction of the dominant system, it is
easy to see that the queues of the dominant system are always
larger in size than those of the original system, provided
they are both initialized to the same value. Therefore, given
λ2 < µ2 , if for some λ1 , the queue at S is stable in the
dominant system, then the corresponding queue in the original
system must be stable; conversely, if for some λ1 in the
dominant system, the queue at node S saturates, then it will
not transmit dummy packets, and as long as S has a packet
to transmit, the behavior of the dominant system is identical
to that of the original system because the dummy packet

To derive the stability condition for the queue in the relay
node, we need to calculate the total arrival rate. There are
two independent arrival processes at the relay: the exogenous
trafﬁc with arrival rate λ2 and the endogenous trafﬁc from S.
In the dominant system, when R receives a dummy packet
from S, it simply discards that packet. When the dominant
system is stable, the queue at S is stable, so the departure rate
of the source packets (excluding the dummy ones) is equal to
the arrival rate λ1 . Denote by SA the event that S transmits a
packet and the packet leaves the queue, then:
Pr(SA ) = [(1 − q2 )Pr(Q2 ̸= 0) + Pr(Q2 = 0)]
× [p13 + (1 − p13 )p12 pa ] (10)

transmissions are increasingly rare as we approach the stability
boundary. Therefore, we can conclude that the original system
and the dominant system are indistinguishable at the boundary
points.
Now we will ﬁnd the value of pa that maximizes λ1 . After
replacing λ1 with y and λ2 with x we have:
y=

−q1 [p13 + (1 − p13 )p12 pa ]

in the dominant system. The service rate for the source node
is
µ1 = q1 (1 − q2 ) [p13 + (1 − p13 )p12 pa ]
(26)
Thus, queue 1 is stable if

The indistinguishability argument at saturations holds here as
well. Next we ﬁnd the value of pa that maximizes λ2 . After

VI. C ONCLUSION
We introduced the notion of partial network-level cooperation by assuming a ﬂow controller for the endogenous trafﬁc
to the relay from the source node of the network in Fig. 1.
We provided an exact characterization of the stability region
for this network. We proved that the system with the ﬂow
controller is always better than or at least equal to the system
without the ﬂow controller. The ﬂow controller regulates the
degree of cooperation offered by the relay.

only by the partial cooperation scheme. The value of p∗ that
a
achieves the boundary is p∗ = λ1 −0.07 , as 0.07 < λ1 < 0.133.

In this case the relay, through the ﬂow controller, regulates
the endogenous trafﬁc from the source by randomly accepting
(with p∗ ) the packets from the source. Note that as λ1 increases

achieve the boundaries of the regions are given in Table I.
The intuition behind these results, is that when the trafﬁc
level at the source is relatively low, the optimal scheme for
the relay is not to cooperate at all. When the trafﬁc level
at the source is high, the best scheme is to fully cooperate,
Finally, when the source has an intermediate level of trafﬁc,
the optimal scheme is to partially offer relay services.

V. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
In this section, we obtain the stability region for the three
cases of no-cooperation, full cooperation and partial cooperation and we compare them in a numerical illustration where
pa < 1. We let q1 = 0.2, q2 = 0.3, p13 = 0.5, p12 = 0.9, and
p23 = 0.8. In Fig. 2, we show the stability regions for the three
cases. The region of partial cooperation contains the regions of
the other cases. The boundaries of the stability region for the
partial cooperation scheme is described by the line segments
ABCD, and contains the region of non-cooperation (ABF )
and the full cooperation (ACD). The triangular area BEC in
Fig. 2 is achieved only by the partial cooperation scheme,
showing that this scheme is superior compared to the rest
schemes.
The line segment AB belongs to the stability region of
both no-cooperation and partial cooperation schemes. It is the
boundary when λ1 ≤ 0.07 (which is the average arrival rate at
the source) and, corresponds to the scheme of no-cooperation
or when p∗ = 0. The line segment CD is the boundary for
a
