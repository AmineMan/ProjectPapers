f (x) for some special values of m [14], and Hu et al. in [6]
generalized it for general even m. Some similar results on
semi-bent functions f (x) were given in [7] when m is odd.
In this paper, we ﬁrst investigate a class of generalized
boolean bent functions of the form

Abstract—New quadratic bent functions in polynomial forms
are constructed in this paper. The constructions give new boolean
bent and generalized boolean bent functions. Based on Z4 valued quadratic forms, a simple method provides several new
constructions of generalized boolean bent functions. From these
generalized boolean bent functions a method is presented to
transform them into binary bent and semi-bent functions.

Boolean bent functions were introduced by Rothaus in 1976
[10]. Let Zl = {0, 1, · · · , l − 1} be the ring of integers
modulo l. An m-variable boolean function from Zm to Z2
2
is bent if it has maximal Hamming distance to the set of
afﬁne boolean functions. Boolean bent functions have attracted
much attention due to their important applications in coding
theory, cryptography and sequence design. From the viewpoint
of cyclic codes over a Galois ring [12], Schmidt introduced the
generalized boolean bent functions from Zm to Zp in 2009.

When p = 4, Sol´ and Tokareva recently have shown the close
e
connections between boolean bent and generalized boolean
bent functions [13].
Let Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q = 2m elements, where
m is a positive integer. Several classes of bent or semi-bent
functions in polynomial form have been constructed using the
theory of quadratic forms over Fq . Let f (x) be a quadratic
function over the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq deﬁned by

generalized boolean bent with even (resp. odd) m.

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Galois Ring
The Galois ring R = GR(4, m) is the Galois extension
of degree m over Z4 . Let µ : Z4 → Z2 be the modulus 2
reduction. Naturally, the mapping µ induces a homomorphism
from the Galois ring R to the ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m with 2m
elements. For simplicity, µ(x) is sometimes denoted by x.

C. Z4 -valued Quadratic Form
A symmetric bilinear form on L is a mapping B : L × L →
Z2 with two properties
1) B(x, y) = B(y, x);
2) B(x ⊕ y, z) = B(x, z) + B(y, z).
Speciﬁcally, B is called alternating if B(x, x) = 0 for all
x ∈ L.
The rank of B is deﬁned as rank(B) = m −
dimZ2 (rad(B)), where

j

(x2 + 2y 2 ), x, y ∈ L.

j=0

The relation between the trace function over Z4 and that over
Z2 is well known:
m
m
1) T r1 (x) = tr1 (x);
m

2) 2T r1 (x) = 2tr1 (x).

rad(B) = {x ∈ L : B(x, y) = 0, ∀ y ∈ L}.

(4)

A Z4 -valued quadratic form [1] is a mapping F : L → Z4
that satisﬁes
1) F (0) = 0, and
2) F (x ⊕ y) = F (x) + F (y) + 2B(x, y),
where B : L × L → Z2 is a symmetric bilinear form. In
addition, F is called alternating if B is alternating. Similarly,
the rank of F is deﬁned as rank(F ) = rank(B).
If F is alternating, it is well known that the Walsh distribution completely depends on its rank [5]. Schmidt developed
the theory of Z4 -valued quadratic form and established the
similar result for f being nonalternating, see [11] for more
details, from which one can easily get the following result.
Lemma 2: ( [11]) For a Z4 -valued quadratic form F (x),
F (x) is generalized boolean bent if and only if F (x) is of
full rank.

It should be noted that the addition operation in L is not
closed. Specially, for any x, y ∈ L, there exists a unique z ∈ L
√
such that z = x + y + 2 xy. For convenience in this paper
we deﬁne a new operation ⊕ on L by
√
x ⊕ y = x + y + 2 xy.
Essentially, (L, ⊕, ·) is isomorphic to (F2m , +, ·).
B. Bent Functions
In this paper, we mainly consider the following two kinds
of bent functions.
1) Boolean bent function: Let f : F2m → F2 be a boolean
function in m variables. The Walsh transform of f is
deﬁned by
∑
m
f (λ) =
(−1)f (x)+tr1 (λx) , λ ∈ F2m .

III. N EW G ENERALIZED B OOLEAN B ENT F UNCTIONS

x∈F2m

For positive integer k, we discuss the generalized boolean
functions Q(x) of the form (1) based on the Z4 -valued
quadratic forms in this section.
Firstly, we need the following lemma.
∑m−1
2i
∈ F2 [x] and
Lemma 3: ( [9]) Let G(x) =
i=0 λi x
∑m−1
λi xi . Then G(x) = 0 has only one root in
g(x) =
i=0
F2m if and only if gcd(g(x), xm − 1) = 1.
Note that Q(x) deﬁned by (1) is a Z4 -valued quadratic form,
and by the deﬁnition one can derive

Then f is bent if |f (λ)| = 2m/2 for all λ ∈ F2m .
2) Generalized boolean bent function: Let f : L → Z4
be a√
generalized boolean function in m variables, and
i = −1. The Walsh transform of f is
∑
m
f (λ) =
if (x)+2T r1 (λx) , λ ∈ L.
x∈L

Then f is bent if |f (λ)| = 2m/2 for all λ ∈ L.
Note that generalized boolean bent functions exist for both
even m and odd m, while boolean bent functions only exist
for even m [10]. A boolean function f (x) in m variables is
called semi-bent if f (λ) ∈ {0, ±2⌊(m+2)/2⌋ } for all λ ∈ Fq
[2], [3].
Sol´ and Tokareva recently studied the connections between
e
binary bent and generalized boolean bent functions, and obtained the following results.
Lemma 1: ( [13]) Let g(x) be a generalized boolean function over Z4 and g(x) = a(x) + 2b(x) be its 2-adic expansion,
where x ∈ L, a(·) and b(·) are boolean functions over F2m .
Let ϕg (y, z) = a(y)z +b(y) be a boolean function in variables
(y, z) with y ∈ F2m and z ∈ Z2 . Then,

Recall that L is isomorphic to F2m under the mapping µ, and
m
m
2T r1 (x) = 2tr1 (x), therefore we discuss the above equality
over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m instead of L in order to be consistent
with Lemma 3. Then together with (4), to determine the rank
of Q(x), we have to consider the roots of

2) For even m, g(x), x ∈ L, is bent if and only if both
b(x) and a(x) + b(x), x ∈ F2m , are bent;
3) If g(x) is bent, then ϕg (y, z) is either bent (m odd) or
semi-bent (m even).

Since x2

gcd(m, (2t + 3)k) = gcd(m, k).
Proof: Similarly, for this case one has

According to Lemma 2, Q(x) is bent if and only if it has
full rank, i.e., (6) has only one root in F2m . By Lemma 3,
one has that (6) has only one root in F2m if and only if
gcd(c(xk ), xm − 1) = 1, where

Then we can obtain the following result.
Theorem 1: The function Q(x) deﬁned by (1) is generalized boolean bent if and only if gcd(c(xk ), xm −1) = 1, where
c(x) is deﬁned by (7).
In what follows, we give some speciﬁc values on ci , 1 ≤
i ≤ ⌊ m−1 ⌋, and discuss the bentness of Q(x) deﬁned by (1).

Thus, gcd(c(x ), x − 1) = 1 if and only if gcd(m, 3k) =

b(x) is semi-bent.
Thus, we can obtain the following result from Theorem 1.

e3 (5, x) = h2,5,6 (x),
e2 (3, x)e(7, x) = h1,4,5 (x),
e(3, x)e(5, x)e(7, x) = h3,5,6 (x).

Theorem 3: Let m and k be positive integers with even
(resp. odd) m and let p(x) be deﬁned by (3). Then the binary
function fQ (x) deﬁned by (2) is bent (resp. semi-bent) if and
only if gcd(c(xk ), xm − 1) = 1, where c(x) is deﬁned by (7).

gcd(m, k), and gcd(m, 7k) = gcd(m, k).

Specially, if one takes Q(x) as the functions obtained in
the Corollaries 1-4 in Section III, then the following bent and
semi-bent functions can be obtained.

We should point out that fQ (x) = p(x) + i=1 tr(x1+2 )
is bent in F2m for even m if and only if gcd(m, (2t + 1)k) =
gcd(m, k). This has been obtained in [6], and we apply a
different approach here. Thus, in the sense of Lemma 1, the
generalized boolean bent function in Corollary 4 is not new
for even m, but it is novel for odd m. Hence, the semi-bent
functions obtained here also are new.

Proof: We only give the proof for case 1), and the other
cases can be similarly proven. According to Theorem 2 and
(8), Q(x) is bent if and only if gcd(h(xk ), xm − 1) = 1,

where h(x) = h2,5,6 (x) = e2 (x)3 = ( x −1 )3 . Then

Remark 1: The function h(x) can be generated by taking
different combinations of e(j, x) or by other functions. Thus,
many new generalized boolean bent functions can be obtained
in a very simple way based on this method.
IV. B INARY B ENT F UNCTIONS O BTAINED F ROM Q(x)
The connections between boolean bent and generalized
boolean bent functions have been revealed in [13]. By Lemma
1, ϕQ is binary bent (resp. semi-bent) for even (resp. odd) m if
Q(x) is generalized boolean bent. In this section, new binary
bent and semi-bent functions can be obtained based on Lemma
1 and the generalized boolean bent functions constructed in
Section III.
First of all, we need the following representation of the trace
function over a Galois ring.
Lemma 4: ( [4]) The trace function over GR(4, m) has 2adic expansion as

tr1 (x), and b(x) = p(x) + i=1 tr1 (ci x1+2 ).
Note that b(x) with x ∈ F2m is in fact the boolean function
fQ (x) deﬁned by (2). For even m, by Lemma 1 one has
that both b(x) and a(x) + b(x) are binary bent if Q(x) is
generalized boolean bent. If m is odd and Q(x) is generalized
boolean bent, again by Lemma 1, one can get

Remark 2: As we mentioned in Remark 1, many new
generalized boolean bent functions can be constructed like
the functions in Corollary 5. Thus, the corresponding new
binary bent and semi-bent functions can also be obtained as
in Corollary 7.
Notice that it is difﬁcult to obtain the new binary bent
and semi-bent functions fQ (x) of the form (2) constructed
in this section based on the theory of quadratic forms over
ﬁnite ﬁelds, but we can easily obtain them by the Z4 -valued
quadratic forms and the links between boolean bent and
generalized boolean bent functions.

(2(m+1)/2 , 0) for all λ ∈ L due to the well known results

The quadratic boolean bent functions and generalized

in this paper. New generalized boolean bent functions Q(x)
of the form (1) are obtained based on the theory of Z4 -valued
quadratic forms, and a method to construct such functions is
also proposed. From these constructions together with the links
between generalized boolean bent and boolean bent functions
[13], new classes of binary bent and semi-bent functions fQ (x)
of the form (2) are presented.
We have to point out that many new p-ary bent functions,
where p is an odd prime, can also be obtained by applying the
same techniques, which are given in the full version of this
paper.
