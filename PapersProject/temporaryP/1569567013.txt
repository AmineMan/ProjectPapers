so by proving that edge-cuts in fact, form fundamental outer
bounds for the communication rates under this trafﬁc model.
In this paper, we show an analogous result for wireless networks under several channel models for which good schemes
are known at a local level. Our results for wireless networks
with symmetric demands include
1) Capacity approximations for networks comprised of
Gaussian MAC and broadcast channels,
2) Degrees-of-freedom approximation for ﬁxed Gaussian
networks, and
3) Capacity approximations for fading Gaussian networks.
At the heart of our achievable scheme is a connection to
“polymatroidal networks” for which the symmetric demands
problem was recently addressed [4]. Our outer bound is based
on the Generalized Network Sharing bound [5], which we
extend to wireless networks in this work.

Abstract—It has been shown recently that a simple layering
principle – local physical-layer schemes combined with global
routing – can achieve approximately optimal performance in
wireless networks. However, this result depends heavily on the
assumption of reciprocity of wireless networks, which may
be violated due to asymmetric power constraints, directional
antennas or frequency-duplexing. In this paper, we show that
the approximate optimality continues to hold even for wireless
networks modeled as directed graphs as long as there is a symmetric demand constraint: every demand from source si to sink ti
at rate Ri has a counterpart demand from source node ti to sink
node si at the same rate. This models several practical scenarios
including voice calls, video calls, and interactive gaming. We
prove this result in the context of several channel models for
which good local schemes exist. The key technical contributions
are an outer bound based on a Generalized Network Sharing
bound for wireless networks and an achievable strategy based
on a connection to polymatroidal networks.

I. I NTRODUCTION

A. Prior Work

The capacity region of multiple unicast in general wireless
networks is an interesting open problem. Recent work [6],
[7], [8] has made progress in this direction by giving an
approximate characterization of this capacity region by using
the reciprocity in wireless channels. It has been shown that
simple layered architectures involving local physical-layer
schemes combined with global routing can achieve approximately optimal performance in wireless networks.
In many practical scenarios, the reciprocity may be affected
due to asymmetric power constraints, directional antennas or
frequency-duplexing. The question we address in this paper
is: “do layered architectures continue to be optimal even
in this case?” We answer this question in the afﬁrmative
under a special trafﬁc model called the symmetric demands
model: there are k specially-marked source-sink pairs of nodes
(si , ti ), i = 1, 2, ..., k with si wanting to communicate an
independent message to ti at rate Ri and ti wanting to
communicate an independent message to si at rate Ri . This
trafﬁc model is valid in several practical scenarios including
voice calls, video calls, and interactive gaming.
The symmetric demands trafﬁc model was originally studied
for wireline networks by Klein, Plotkin, Rao and Tardos
[1], who established that the routing rate region and edgecuts are within a factor O(log2 k) of each other. This result,
however, does not establish that routing is approximately
optimal since edge-cuts do not, in general, bound the rate of
general communication schemes. A companion paper [2] does

Single hop wireless networks (called interference and Xnetworks) have been studied extensively in recent times,
starting with the seminal work of [12], which proposed an
interference alignment scheme (building on [13]) by which
each user in a fast fading interference channel can achieve half
the degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. This result has been
extended to a variety of other scenarios, including interference
channel with ﬁxed channel coefﬁcients [15], [16], approximate
capacity characterization of ergodic interference channels [14].
In this paper, we build on these results to obtain results for a
network comprised of such channels.
Wireless networks with multiple hops have also been studied under several trafﬁc models, starting from the capacity
approximation for unicast and multicast trafﬁc in [17], the
multiple-source single-sink case in [18] and broadcast trafﬁc
in [19].
Multiple-unicast in general wireless networks has started
receiving attention only recently. Certain classes of 2-unicast
problems were studied in [21], 2-unicast deterministic networks were studied in [26], and the degrees-of-freedom of
2-unicast was established in [20]. K-unicasts in certain topologies were studied in [22] where K sources communicate to K
sinks via L fully-connected layers of K relays each. Compute
and forward schemes for layered networks were presented in
[23]. Multiple multicasts in networks of 2-user Gaussian MAC
and broadcast channels was studied in [24], where a separation
scheme was shown to be approximately optimal. While these

1

existing works attempt to compute the degrees-of-freedom
(or approximate capacity) exactly for speciﬁc instances of
the problem, we adopt a different viewpoint and focus our
attention on obtaining general results for arbitrary networks at
the expense of obtaining potentially weaker approximation in
speciﬁc instances.

for the directed graphs with symmetric demands problem.
This result along with (1) establishes that routing is within
a factor O(log2 k) optimal. The basic engine in the proof is
the bound established in [5] called the Generalized Network
Sharing (GNS) bound. The GNS bound establishes that certain
edge cuts which disconnect si from tj , whenever i ≥ j
are fundamental. The basic idea in the proof of [2] is a
combinatorial argument showing that, in the directed graph
with symmetric demands problem, there is a re-labeling of
si and ti (by swapping and permutation) such that any given
edge cut can be seen to be a so-called GNS-cut.

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide the basic background on which
the main results are then built.
A. Directed Graph with Symmetric Demands

C. Polymatroidal Networks

We review the directed wireline network problem with symmetric demands. There is a directed wireline graph G = (V, E)
with capacity functions c(e) ∀e ∈ E and k source-sink pairs
(si , ti ), i = 1, 2, ..., k. For the symmetric demands problem,
a rate tuple (R1 , ..., Rk ) is said to be achievable if si can
communicate to ti at rate Ri and ti can communicate at si at
rate Ri . A fundamental question in this context is “How good
is routing?”.
The optimal performance achievable by routing can be
written as a linear program, whose solution can be computed
in time that grows only polynomial with the size of the graph
(see [1]). Let Rf denote the set of all k-tuples achievable by
routing. An obvious bound on the rate of ﬂow is the edge-cut
bound, deﬁned as follows. Given a subset of edges (called an
edge-cut) F ⊆ E, let c(F ) := e∈F c(e) denotes the capacity
of the cut. Let K(F ) denote the set of i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k} such
that either there is no path from si to ti or there is no path
between ti to si in E \ F . Now, the edge-cut bound is given
by i∈K(F ) Ri ≤ c(F ). The set of rate tuples that satisfy all
the edge-cut bounds is called the edge-cut bound region Re.c. .
Note that if for some index i ∈ K(F ), there is no path from
si to ti and no path from ti to si in E \ F, then we could have
a tighter inequality with the co-efﬁcient of Ri being 2 instead
of 1. These tighter inequalities are not always fundamental
(i.e., they do not upper bound general network coding rates of
communication, only those achievable via routing), but in any
case, they result in tighter bounds by at most a factor of two.
A classical result [1] shows that
1
Re.c. ⊆ Rf ⊆ Re.c. ,
O(log2 k)

A standard wireline network model is an edge-capacitated
graph; each edge is associated with a capacity that constrains
the total amount of information that can be communicated on
it. Polymatroidal networks are a strictly more general model
and handle additional constraints when edges meet at a node,
similar in spirit to the broadcast and interference constraints in
wireless. In particular, we study a directed graph G = (V, E)
where the constraints on the information ﬂow fe on edge e
are given by
f (e) ≤ ρin (Sv ) ∀Sv ⊆ In{v}
v

(2)

f (e) ≤ ρout (Sv ) ∀Sv ⊆ Out{v},
v

(3)

e:e∈Sv

e:e∈Sv

where ρin (·) and ρout (·) are polymatroidal functions on the
v
v
corresponding input sets.
While prior work establishes a max-ﬂow min-cut result for
unicast communication [9], [10] and broadcast trafﬁc [11],
recent work has established approximate max-ﬂow min-cut
results for the case of both bi-directed polymatroidal networks
and for polymatroidal networks with symmetric demands.
We recall the following theorem from [4], which generalizes the results of [1] to the case of polymatroidal capacity
networks:
Theorem 1. [4] For a directed polymatroidal network with k
source-destination pairs having symmetric demands,

i.e., the rate region achievable by ﬂow is within an O(log2 k)
factor of the edge-cut bound.

III. G AUSSIAN NETWORKS COMPOSED OF B ROADCAST
AND M ULTIPLE ACCESS C HANNELS
The communication network is represented by a directed
graph G = (V, E), and an edge coloring ψ : E → C,
where C is the set of colors. Each node v has a set of colors
C(v) ⊆ C on which it operates. Each color can be thought
of as an orthogonal resource, and therefore the broadcast and
interference constraints for the wireless channel apply only
within a given color. The channel model can therefore be
written as,

B. GNS Outer Bound
While the edge-cut bound is an upper bound on the ﬂow,
it is not clear if the edge-cut bound is an upper bound on
the rates achievable by arbitrary coding schemes. In fact, it is
known [25] that edge-cuts do not bound the capacity region
for general directed graphs (for general directed graphs, the
edge-cut is any subset of edges that disconnects si from ti ,
for all i ∈ K for some subset K).
In a recent companion work [2], we show that edge cut
bounds give fundamental upper bounds on the capacity region

where xc , yi , zi are the transmitted vector, received vector and

ji
node i and node j on color c and Inc (i) represents the set
of in-neighbors of node i who are operating on color c and
dc (i) = |Nc (i)| be the degree of node i in color c. Let d =
maxc,v dc (v) be the maximum degree of any node in a given
color; therefore, d is the maximum number of users on any
component broadcast or multiple access channel.
A network is composed of broadcast and multiple access
channels if and only if no edge is involved simultaneously
in a broadcast and interference constraint inside the same
color. We will call such a network a “Gaussian MAC+BC
network”. We will assume that each color represents a distinct
MAC or broadcast channel without loss of generality. Each
node has a power constraint P to transmit on each edge. If
there are distinct power constraints for different nodes, they
can be absorbed into the channel co-efﬁcient without loss of
generality.
1) Edge-cut bound: The edge cut bound for the gaussian
MAC+BC network is deﬁned by the following: consider any
set F ⊆ E, as in the wireline case, let K(F ) denote the set of
i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k} such that either there is no path from si to ti
or there is no path between ti to si in E \ F . The capacity of
the cut c(F ) is deﬁned, in the obvious way, as the sum of three
terms: the capacities of the orthogonal links in F , the sumcapacity of sub-MAC components of F and the sum-capacity
of sub-BC components of F , where sum-capacity of subMAC (sub-BC) component is computed assuming complete
coordination among source (destination) terminals of the subMAC (sub-BC) component. The edge-cut bound region is now
given as

Re.c. = {(R1 , ..., Rk ) :

Ri ≤ c(F ) ∀F ⊆ E}.

B. Outer bound

We ﬁrst establish that the edge-cut bound is fundamental,
i.e., every communication scheme must have rate pairs that lie
inside this region: C ⊆ Re.c. . A GNS-cut is an edge-cut with
stronger disconnection properties. More precisely, the edge-cut
that disconnects si from ti for i = 1, 2, . . . , k is a GNS-cut
if there exists a permutation π : {1, 2, . . . , k} → {1, 2, . . . , k}
such that the edge-cut disconnects si from tj whenever π(i) ≥
π(j). The key argument is a bound based on GNS cuts for
Gaussian MAC+BC networks:
Lemma 1. For the Gaussian MAC+BC network with symmetric demands, every GNS cut F is fundamental, i.e.,
i∈K(F ) Ri ≤ c(F ) for any communication scheme achieving
(R1 , ..., Rk ).
Proof: Without loss of generality, let F be a GNS-cut
disconnecting si from ti for i = 1, 2, . . . , k with say, the
identity permutation πid . Thus, K(F ) = {1, 2, . . . , k}. We
ﬁrst provide a proof of the bound for networks with acyclic
underlying graph G.
Let C = M ∪ B where M consists of the colors of edges
involved in MAC components and B consists of colors of
edges involved in broadcast components or orthogonal links.
For µ ∈ C, let Aµ denote the set of edges involved in µ.
Now, consider a directed graph G with nodes represented by
Aµ , µ ∈ C as follows: there exists a directed edge from Aµ
to Aν in G if and only if there exists an edge in Aµ that is
upstream to some edge in Aν in the given DAG G. Since the
set of all edges with a given color constitute either a MAC or
a BC or form a single orthogonal link, we have that G is a
directed acyclic graph. Thus, we can have a total order on the
vertices of G consistent with the partial order of ancestry in
G . This gives a total order on D := {µ ∈ C : F ∩ Aµ = ∅},
which may be presumed to be, say µ1 < µ2 < . . . < µr ,
where µ1 is the most “upstream”.

(6)

i∈K(F )

As in the wireline network case, it is not immediately obvious
if Re.c. is an outer bound to the capacity region.
A. Multiple Unicast in Gaussian MAC+BC Networks
There are k pairs of nodes si , ti , i = 1, 2, ..., k, where node
si has a message to send to ti and ti has a message to send
to si at rate Ri . We would like to characterize the set of all
achievable rate tuples, called the capacity region C. We will
use Rach to denote rates achievable by our proposed simple
scheme, Re.c. to denote the edge-cut region and C to denote
the capacity region. Our main result is the following.

•

Theorem 2. For the k-unicast problem with symmetric demands in a Gaussian MAC+BC network, the edge-cut bound
is fundamental and a simple separation strategy can achieve
Rach (P ) which satisﬁes,
Re.c. ( P )
d
O(log2 k)

⊆ Rach (P ) ⊆ C(P ) ⊆ Re.c. (P ).

•

(7)

Thus, the edge-cut bound is a fundamental upper bound on
the capacity region and furthermore the edge-cut bound, scaled
1
down in power by a factor d and in rate by a factor O(log2 k) ,
can be achieved by the proposed scheme.

For µ ∈ M, we denote transmissions along edge e in
Aµ by Xe and we denote the reception by Yµ so that
Yµ =
e∈Aµ Xe + Zµ where Zµ is Gaussian noise.
Further, deﬁne Uµ := {Xe : e ∈ F ∩ Aµ }, and
Vµ := e∈F ∩Aµ Xe + Zµ .
For µ ∈ B, we denote the transmission on the broadcast
component or orthogonal link by Xµ and the receptions
at heads of e ∈ Aµ by Ye so that Ye = Xµ + Ze where
{Ze , e ∈ Aµ } are independent Gaussian noise random
variables. Further deﬁne Uµ := Xµ , and Vµ := {Ye : e ∈
F ∩ Aµ }.

The result from the companion paper [2], states that for the
directed graph with symmetric demands problem: any edgecut is basically a GNS-cut. Using this result in conjunction
with Lemma 1, gives us the desired result: C(P ) ⊆ Re.c. (P ).

C. Coding Scheme
The coding scheme is a separation-based strategy: each
component broadcast or multiple access channel is coded
for independently creating bit-pipes on which information is
routed globally. In order to evaluate the rate region of this
scheme, we use polymatroidal networks as an interface for
which we can show that routing and edge-cut are close to
each other.
Let us ﬁrst consider the coding for the multiple access channel with channel coefﬁcients h1 , ..., hd and power constraint
P at each of the d nodes. Let the rate region achievable on
this multiple access channel be denoted by

Now, each multiple access or broadcast channel

Thus the network induced by using this coding scheme falls
under the category of directed polymatroidal networks with
symmetric demands. We now invoke Theorem 1 to show
that the routing rate region and the edge-cut bounds in the
polymatroidal network are within a factor of log2 k of each

In this section, we consider general Gaussian networks, i.e.,
networks where broadcast and MAC can occur simultaneously.
Our network-level results are under the following two settings:
1) Degrees-of-freedom in ﬁxed Gaussian channels 2) Capacity
approximation in ergodic Gaussian channels. Due to lack of
space, we only state the main results, referring the reader to
[3] for detailed proofs.
A. Fixed Gaussian Channels
We consider a communication network with the edges of
the network having fading coefﬁcients on them, each chosen
independently from a continuous fading distribution. Our main
result is the following:
Theorem 3. For a directed wireless network with symmetric
demands, if the ﬁxed channel coefﬁcients are drawn from
a continuous distribution, the DOF region given by Dach
satisfying
De.c.
⊆ Dach ⊆ D ⊆ De.c. ,
O(log2 k)
is achievable.
B. Ergodic Wireless Networks
In an ergodic wireless network, the channel model is similar
to the ﬁxed Gaussian network, except that we assume that
all the non-zero fading coefﬁcients are varying as a function
of time in an i.i.d. manner according to a fading distribution
which is assumed to be symmetric and to satisfy a weak tail
2
assumption: a := e−E(log |h| ) < ∞. One example of such a
fading distribution is the i.i.d. complex gaussian distribution,
for which a ≈ 1.78 [27]. The main result is stated below.
Theorem 4. For a directed Gaussian network with symmetric
demands and with ergodic fading distribution, the rate region
given by Rach (P ) satisfying
P
Re.c. ( ad3 )

O(log2 k)

⊆ Rach (P ) ⊆ C(P ) ⊆ Re.c. (P ),

is achievable.
