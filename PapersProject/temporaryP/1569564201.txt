Rotating-table game and construction of periodic sequences with lightweight
calculation
Min Zeng, Yuan Luo, and Guang Gong
Abstract— A well-known operator of vectors over ﬁnite ﬁeld
is the derivative, which is used to investigate the complexity of
vectors in game theory, communication theory and cryptography. According to the operator, a corresponding complexity of
the vector is called (the ﬁrst) depth, which also contributes to
two other deﬁnitions (the second and the third depths) by using
polynomial factor and high order difference, respectively. For
an n-dimensional vector over Fq (a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements
and characteristic p), the three depths are the same as its linear
complexity if n = pr (r ≥ 0).
In this paper, by investigation on vectors s of length n (or
equivalent sequences of period n) with inﬁnite third depth,
and the cyclic-left-shift-difference operator E-1 on s, long least
ultimate period sequences {(E−1)i (s)}i≥0 are constructed with
high probability over big alphabet using lightweight calculation.
Furthermore, distributions of sequences s with period n = pr −1
(r > 0), are described in terms of the least ultimate periods of
{(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 .
In addition, we depict circulant matrix structure of the
operator (E − 1)i for 0 < i < n and determine its rank.
Some upper bounds on the ultimate period of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0
and a method to determine the least ultimate period are
provided. The least ultimate period presents an adversary a
sufﬁcient condition to win the rotating-table game with rapid
counteraction (RGRC).

I. I NTRODUCTION
The linear complexity of sequences is an important measure for stream cipher systems. Various authors investigated
the linear complexity by using the linear recurrence relations
among terms of sequences (e.g., LFSR) [2]–[4], [6]–[9]. For
sequences with ﬁnite lengths (i.e., vectors), Etzion studied
a complexity by using differences of adjacent terms of the
vectors (e.g., difference sequences [1]), which he called (the
ﬁrst) ‘depth’. He proved that the depth of a binary vector with
length 2r (r > 0) is equal to its linear complexity, and also
showed that the depth distribution of the nonzero codewords
of an [n, k] linear code consists of exactly k nonzero values
[5]. Luo, Fu and Wei studied more counting properties about
the depth distributions of linear codes [10]. Meanwhile, Roth
studied another complexity (the second depth) of a vector in

terms of the factors of its generating function [5]. Mitchell
extended the ﬁrst depth for sequences with inﬁnite length,
which is called the third depth in this research. The third
depth of a vector (or a sequence) is either ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
He showed that the set of binary sequences with inﬁnite
length and ﬁnite third depth, is equal to the set of binary
sequences with period 2r for some r ≥ 0. The corresponding
depth distributions of all cyclic codes were also provided by
Mitchell [11]. For an n-dimensional vector over Fq (a ﬁnite
ﬁeld with q elements and characteristic p), the three depths
are the same as its linear complexity if n = pr (r ≥ 0) [5],
[12].
In fact, (the third) depth was introduced by Yehuda,
Etzion, and Moran for studying a classic rotating-table game
[12], in which two players, A (an adversary) and B, play a
game consisting of manipulations of vectors of length n over
Fq . They showed that the player B can win the game if and
only if n and q are powers of the same prime, and provided a
general sufﬁcient condition in form of the minimum number
of rounds, i.e., the ﬁnite third depth of the initial vector,
about the adversary A to lose the classic rotating-table game.
Evidently, if the third depth is inﬁnite, this game is endless
(inﬁnite loop), which implies the victory of the adversary. A
new intriguing problem is to ﬁnd the minimum number of
rounds to ensure the victory of the adversary. We consider
a simpliﬁed strategy called rotating-table game with rapid
counteraction (RGRC). Two players, an adversary and a
system manager, seat by a rotating round table with n
roulettes of q sides each. Denote the sides of the roulettes by
0, 1, . . . , q − 1, which mean the statuses of the roulettes. The
game starts after the system manager has selected a side for
each roulette on the table (i.e., selecting an n-dimensional
vector s). For each round, the adversary is allowed to do once
such operation: revolve the table counterclockwise by a unitangle 360◦ /n and then rotate each roulette by an angle to
counteract the status of previous roulette at the same location
at once (i.e., performing an operator (E − 1)(s) which is a
cyclic-left-shift-difference operator on s). The adversary wins
the game if he ﬁnds that some nonzero repeated vectors appear (i.e., the ultimate period of a sequence {(E−1)i (s)}i≥0
appears).
Motivated by the game RGRC, this paper focuses on
the n-dimensional vector s (or the sequence of period n)
with inﬁnite third depth, especially on the case of n =
pr − 1 (r > 0). The vector s is further investigated by determining the least ultimate period of the corresponding
sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,

the sequence {(E−1)i (s)}i≥0 is deﬁned, and the three depth
deﬁnitions are presented as well as three vector operators. In
Section III, we generally depict the circulent matrix structure
of the operator (E − 1)i (s) for 0 < i < n and determine
its rank. Section IV is for the vector s with inﬁnite third
depth. By investigating the ultimate period of the sequence
{(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 , a sufﬁcient condition for the victory of
the adversary in RGRC is provided, and some other explicit
and interesting results are obtained, such as upper bounds
on the ultimate periods, a method of determining the least
ultimate periods, and the least ultimate period spectrums and
distributions of the sequences with period n = pr −1 in terms
of the least ultimate period of {(E−1)i (s)}i≥0 . Note that the
period is not equivalent to the least period here. Section
V gives an efﬁcient method of constructing long least period
sequences over Fqn from vectors over Fq . Section VI is of
ﬁnal conclusion.
II. N OTATIONS AND D EFINITIONS
Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements and characteristic
p. Suppose that Vn (q) and V∞ (q) are the n-dimensional
vector space and the set of inﬁnite sequences over Fq ,
respectively. Fq [x] denotes the polynomial ring over Fq .
Let s = (s0 , s1 , . . . , sn−1 ) be an n-dimensional vector over
Fq , and its generating function is deﬁned as s(x) = s0 +
s1 x + . . . + sn−1 xn−1 . Let S = (s0 , s1 , s2 , . . .) be an inﬁnite
sequence over Fq . If S is a periodic sequence with least
period n, we also denote S = (s0 , s1 , . . . , sn−1 ) when the
context is clear. [λn ] = (λ, λ . . . , λ) denotes a vector with n
consecutive appearances of λ ∈ Fq . For a ﬁnite set X, its
cardinality is denoted by |X|. For a vector (or matrix) X,
X⊤ denotes the transpose of X. Let G(f ) be the set of all
sequences over Fq generated by f (x). Subsection II-A lists
the deﬁnitions of three kinds of vector depths, and Subsection
II-B presents the deﬁnition of Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 .
A. The deﬁnitions of three kinds of vector depths
The operators of a vector, such as the derivative, the cyclicleft-shift, and the cyclic-left-shift-difference, are used in connection with its complexity. Their matrix representations are
presented in (2.1), (2.2), and (2.4), respectively. Deﬁnition
4, Deﬁnition 5, and Deﬁnition 6 are of the three kinds of
depths.
Deﬁnition 1: [10] The derivative D: Vn (q) → Vn−1 (q)
is deﬁned as follows:
D(s0 , s1 , . . . , sn−1 ) = (s1 − s0 , s2 − s1 , . . . , sn−1 − sn−2 ).
Thus D(s) = sAn where

Note that Di (s) = sAn An−1 . . . An−(i−1) (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1).
Deﬁnition 2: [12] The cyclic-left-shift E: Vn (q) → Vn (q)
is deﬁned as follows:
E(s) = E(s0 , s1 , . . . , sn−1 ) = (s1 , . . . , sn−1 , s0 ).
Thus E(s)=sT where

Note that Ei (s) = E(Ei−1 (s)) = sTi (i ≥ 1) and E0 (s) = s.
An immediate consequence of (2.2) is the following formula
Tn = I (the identity matrix of order n).

Deﬁnition 3: [12] The cyclic-left-shift-difference E-1:
Vn (q) → Vn (q) is deﬁned as follows:
(E − 1)(s) = (s1 − s0 , s2 − s1 , . . . , s0 − sn−1 ).
Thus (E − 1)(s) = sA where

Note that (E−1)i (s) = (E−1)((E−1)i−1 (s)) = sAi (i ≥ 1)
and (E − 1)0 (s) = s.
Using the above operators, Etzion initially presented the
ideas of depths in [5] and [12]. To distinguish these concepts
over Fq , we classify them into three kinds as follows.
Deﬁnition 4: Let s = (s0 , s1 , s2 , . . . , sn−1 ) ∈ Vn (q). If
there exists the smallest nonnegative integer m such that
Dm (s) = [0n−m ], the ﬁrst depth of s is deﬁned to be m,
which is denoted by l1 (s), otherwise the depth is deﬁned to
be n. Obviously, l1 (s) ≤ n.
Deﬁnition 5: Let s = (s0 , s1 , s2 , . . . , sn−1 ) ∈ Vn (q) and
∑n−1
s(x) = i=0 si xi . The second depth of s is deﬁned to be the
smallest nonnegative integer m such that (x − 1)m s(x) ≡
0 (mod (x − 1)n ), which is denoted by l2 (s). Obviously,
l2 (s) ≤ n.
Deﬁnition 6: Let s = (s0 , s1 , s2 , . . . , sn−1 ) ∈ Vn (q). If
there exists the smallest nonnegative integer m such that (E−
1)m (s) = [0n ], the third depth of s is deﬁned to be m, which
is denoted by l3 (s), otherwise the depth is deﬁned to be
inﬁnite.
Example 1: Let s = (0, β, 1, 0, 0, β, 1) ∈ V7 (4), where β
is a root of f (x) = x2 + x + 1 over F4 . Then l1 (s) = 4,
l2 (s) = 3, and l3 (s) = ∞

B. The deﬁnition of Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 and the
structure of operator (E − 1)i
In the rotating-table game RGRC in Section I, we have a
sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 which is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 7.
Deﬁnition 7: The sequence {(E−1)i (s)}i≥0 is a sequence
of n-dimensional vectors over Fq , which is denoted by S and
deﬁned as follows:
(s⊤ , ((E − 1)(s))⊤ , ((E − 1)2 (s))⊤ , . . . , ((E − 1)i (s))⊤ , . . .),
where ((E − 1)i (s))⊤ is the ith term of the sequence S.
Sequence S is an ultimately periodic sequence. Its least
ultimate period, denoted by P(S), is the least positive integer
P such that ∃M, f or all i ≥ M ,
(E − 1)i (s) = (E − 1)i+P (s), i.e.,

(2.5)

(Ai+P − Ai )⊤ s⊤ = [0n ]⊤ ,

(2.6)

where the smallest M with respect to the least P is called
the preperiod [3]. If M = 0, the sequence is said to be a
periodic sequence. Obviously, for s with ﬁnite third depth, it
follows that P(S) = 1.
Remark 1: With the notation in Deﬁnition 7, for s with
inﬁnite third depth and M = 0, if we interpret each term
of S as an element in Fqn , then we obtain a new sequence
with least period P(S) over Fqn , which is denoted by S ′ .

IV. T HE ULTIMATE PERIOD OF S EQUENCE
{(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 AND CORRESPONDING DISTRIBUTION OF
SEQUENCES WITH PERIOD pr − 1 OVER Fq
To investigate the vectors s in Vn (q) with inﬁnite third
depth, or equivalently periodic sequences (s, s, . . .) in V∞ (q)
with inﬁnite third depth, this section provides a relation
among s and its difference vectors (E − 1)i (s) (i ≥ 1).
The relation is of the least ultimate period of Sequence
{(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 , which provides the adversary a sufﬁcient
condition in form of the minimum number of rounds to win
the RGRC.
A. The ultimate period of Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0
Recall Deﬁnition 7, Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 has ultimate period P if there exist P and M such that (E−1)i (s) =
(E − 1)i+P (s) for all i ≥ M . For general n, Proposition 3
gives an upper bound on the ultimate period of Sequence
{(E−1)i (s)}i≥0 . Theorem 1 provides a method of determining the least ultimate period of Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0
for any ﬁxed s.
Proposition 3: Let s ∈ Vn (q) and p be the characteristic
′
of Fq . Then pL − pL is an ultimate period of Sequence
i
{(E − 1) (s)}i≥0 , where L = max{k : pk |n, k ≥ 0}, L′ =
L + ϕ( pn ), and ϕ(x) is the Euler phi-function.
L
Remark 2: Proposition 3 implies that for a given n there
′
does exist an upper bound (e.g., pL − pL ) on the ultimate
i
period of Sequence {(E − 1) (s)}i≥0 for all s ∈ Vn (q).
From Proposition 3, for some special n, we have the
following corollary.
Corollary 1: Let s ∈ Vn (q) and p be the characteristic of
Fq .
1) If p n, then there exists an r = ϕ(n) such that n|pr − 1
and pr − 1 is an ultimate period of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 .
2) If p|n, but p2 n, then n|p(pr − 1) where r = ϕ( n ) and
p
p(pr − 1) is an ultimate period of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 .
We next study the least ultimate period of Sequence
{(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 . By Deﬁnition 7, the least ultimate period
of Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 (i.e., S) can be clearly deﬁned
as follows:
P(S) = min{j − i : ∃i < j, (E − 1)i (s) = (E − 1)j (s)}.
(4.8)
However, it is inconvenient to determine the least ultimate
period by using its deﬁnition. Theorem 1 presents a simple
method on determining P(S).
Theorem 1: For a vector s ∈ Vn (q) with third depth
l3 (s) = ∞, let
J(s) = min{j : ∃i < j, (E − 1)i (s) = (E − 1)j (s)}, (4.9)

j=0

We next determine the rank of A (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) which
will be used in Section V.
Proposition 2: Let p be the characteristic of Fq and L =
max{k : pk |n, k ≥ 0} where n is the order of A. Then
rank(Ai ) = n − i if 1 ≤ i ≤ pL , and rank(Ai ) = n − pL if
pL < i < n.
i

3

and let I(s) be the unique i < J(s) such that (E − 1)i (s) =
(E−1)J(s) (s). Then the least ultimate period P(S) is J(s)−
I(s).
Remark 3: In Theorem 1, the calculation of (4.9) needs
to ﬁnd the ﬁrst j (increasing from 0) such that there exists
i < j satisfying (E−1)i (s) = (E−1)j (s). Then P(S) = j−i
and the preperiod is i.

We give an example illustrating our results.
Example 2: Let s = (2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1) ∈ V8 (3). Since
n = 8 = 32 − 1, we obtain from Corollary 1 1) and
Proposition 3, respectively, that 8 and 80 are ultimate periods
of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 . Furthermore, it is easy to verify from
Theorem 1 that P(S) = 4.
Finally in this section, recall the game RGRC in Section
I. For example, the system manager selects the vector in
Example 2, i.e., s = (2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1) ∈ V8 (3). It is clear
that the least ultimate period of the corresponding sequence
{(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 is 4 and the preperiod is 1, which implies
that the adversary certainly wins the game if the number of
rounds is larger than or equal to 5.
Remark 4: A sufﬁcient condition for the adversary to win
the RGRC is that the number of rounds is larger than or equal
to the sum of the least ultimate period and the preperiod of
Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 where l3 (s) = ∞.
B. The distribution of sequences with period pr − 1 over Fq
To further distinguish vectors s ∈ Vn (q) (or equivalent
sequences of period n) with third depth l3 (s) = ∞, we try to
classify them in terms of the least ultimate periods of their
respective sequences {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 . The corresponding
distribution is considered in Deﬁnition 8. If n = pr − 1,
Theorem 2 presents the least ultimate period spectrum and
distribution for the case p = 2, where {DP : P ̸= 1}
classiﬁes the vectors s ∈ Vn (q) with l3 (s) = ∞ in terms
of P(S) (see Deﬁnition 7); Theorem 3 discusses the case
p ̸= 2.
Deﬁnition 8: Let DP be the number of vectors s ∈ Vn (q)
with P(S) = P . Then the set {DP : P ≥ 1} is called the
distribution of n-dimensional vectors in terms of the least
ultimate period of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 , and the set {P : DP >
0} is called the least ultimate period spectrum of {(E −
1)i (s)}i≥0 .
Theorem 2: Let p = 2 be the characteristic of Fq and s ∈
∏N
n
Vn (q). Suppose that n = pr − 1= i=1 wi i where wi ’s are
distinct prime factors of n and ni ’s are all positive integers.
Then the least ultimate period spectrum of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0
is the set

{DP = q P −

In particular, D1 = q, Dwi = q wi −q, Dwti = q wi −q wi ,

and Dwi wj = q wi wj − q wi − q wj + q.
Theorem 3: Let p ̸= 2 be the characteristic of Fq and s ∈

distinct prime factors of n and ni ’s are all positive integers.

Example 3: For s ∈ V8 (3), the least ultimate period
spectrum is {1, 4, 8} (without 2) and the corresponding
distribution is {9, 72, 6480}, where the set of vectors with
P(S) = 1 and l3 (s) = ∞ is given as follows.
{(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1), (0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2),
(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2),
(2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0), (2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)}.

V. A PPLICATION RELATED TO THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF
VECTORS

Recall Remark 1 that if we interpret each term of periodic
sequence S as an element in Fqn , then we obtain a new
sequence S ′ with least period P(S) over Fqn . That is to say,
the inﬁnite third depth provides a way to construct a long
least period sequence over Fqn from a vector over Fq . For
example, let s = (1, 2, 0, 2, 1) ∈ V5 (3), then l3 (s) = ∞ and
P(S) = 80. And let f (x) = x5 + x4 + x2 + 1 be a primitive
polynomial over F3 and β a root of f (x) over F35 . Thus the
terms in the ﬁrst period of S ′ are given as follows.

In this section, for all s ∈ Vn (q), we introduce an
algorithm of determining their distribution in terms of the
least ultimate period of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 , and then illustrate
that we can construct a long least period sequence over Fqn
from a vector over Fq with a high probability.

Algorithm 1 Computing the distribution of n-dimensional
vectors over Fq
1: Input: n, the dimension of vectors over Fq ; p, the
characteristic of Fq .
2: Output: The distribution of n-dimensional vectors s over
Fq in terms of the least ultimate periods of S

Step 1: Generate an n × n matrix A satisfying (2.4).
Step 2: Determine L = max{k : pk |n, k ≥ 0} and
L′ = L + ϕ( pn ) where ϕ(x) is the Euler phi-function
L
of a positive integer x.
Step 3: G ←− ∅; i ←− pL + 1;
Step 4: Obtain all different generator matrices GP ,
′
while i ≤ pL do
L
P ←− i − pL ; HP ←− (Ai − Ap )⊤ ;
if (HP == 0) then
∪
GP ←− I; G ←− G {GP }; goto Step 5;
end if
Transform HP into [IRP , Γ];
GP ←− [−Γ⊤ , In−RP ];
if (GP ∈ G) ∪
/
then
G ←− G {GP };
end if
i ←− i + 1;
end while
Step 5: Generate all cyclic codes CP from GP , respectively.
Step 6: Compute the number of vectors s with P(S) =
P : DP = |CP − ∪k∈K Ck | where K = {k : k|P, 1 ≤
k < P }.
Step 7: Return {DP : P ≥ 1} and {P : DP > 0}.

Remark 5: In Algorithm 1, let Pmax = P when HP =
L
L
(AP +p − Ap )⊤ = 0. Then Pmax is the least P such that
L
L
AP +p − Ap = 0, and an ultimate period of all sequences
S corresponding to s ∈ Vn (q) (see (2.6)). Thus P |Pmax if
P ∈ {P : DP > 0}. In addition, let RP = rank(HP ). Since
L
L
L
L
(AP +p − Ap ) = Ap (AP − I) and rank(Ap ) = n − pL
(see Proposition 2), it follows that 0 ≤ RP ≤ n − pL . In
particular, RPmax = 0.
Recall Deﬁnition 8, from the inclusion-exclusion principle,
the following proposition holds. Note that we call x a
maximal factor of y if x|y and for ∀z(̸= x, y)|y, we have
x z.
Proposition 4: Let Pi ∈ {P : DP > 0} (i = 1, 2, . . . , m)
L
L
and RPi = rank(HPi ) where HPi = (APi +p − Ap )⊤ . If
Pi is a maximal factor of Pmax , then the Pi is denoted by
Pi∗ . Let m∗ = |{Pi∗ }|. Then the number of n-dimensional
vectors over Fq with P(S) = Pmax is
DPmax

Example 4: For s ∈ V63 (2), we have Pmax = 63 and
D63 = 263 − 221 − 29 + 23 .
Corollary 2: If n = pr − 1 where p is the characteristic
D
q−2
of Fq , then Pmax ≫ q−1 .

Therefore, we have such an assertion that Pmax approxqn
imately equals to 1 if q is large. That is, if n = pr − 1,
we can select a vector s over Fq with a high probability to
construct a sequence S ′ of least period Pmax (i.e., n) over
Fqn . Since these sequences S ′ are long period sequences
over the extension ﬁeld and the difference operator in the
method is simple, they could be used in lightweight cipher
applications.
VI. C ONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK
This research is on the period of {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 where
s has inﬁnite third depth. An application of the inﬁnite third
depth is in the rotating-table game with rapid counteraction
(RGRC). If the number of rounds is larger than or equal to
the sum of the least ultimate period and the preperiod of
Sequence {(E − 1)i (s)}i≥0 where l3 (s) = ∞, the adversary
wins the game. Another application is to provide two efﬁcient methods of constructing long least period sequences
that could be used in lightweight cipher applications. One is
to construct sequences over Fqn from vectors over Fq with
a high probability, and the other is to construct difference
interleaved sequences from m-sequences, which is not discussed here owing to the limitation of space.
