neutralization has been proposed in [5] for K-user K-hop
networks showing that the optimal K DoF is achievable
for isotropic fading. More recently, the result in [4] has
been generalized to 2-user multi-hop networks [6], [7].

Abstract—We investigate how the network connectivity can
affect the degrees of freedom (DoF) of wireless networks. We
consider a network of n source–destination (SD) pairs and
assume that any two nodes are connected with a positive
probability p, independent of other node pairs. We show that,
for any arbitrarily small p, a constant DoF is achievable for
every SD pair with probability approaching one as n tends to
inﬁnity. The achievability is based on the two-hop transmission
with decode-and-forward relaying and over each-hop we adopt
interference alignment. Considering that an achievable per-user
DoF for direct or one-hop transmission can be arbitrarily small
as the connectivity probability p decreases, our result shows
that, somewhat surprisingly, two-hop transmission is enough to
guarantee non-vanishing per-user DoF for any p showing that
sparsely connected networks can still provide non-vanishing peruser DoF.

The main focus of interference networks and partially connected interference networks is on concrete understanding of
small-scale networks and developing fundamental interference
management techniques for basic communication blocks. In
this paper, we address the question how the network connectivity can affect the overall DoF of large-scale networks. Before
specifying this question, we will brieﬂy introduce related
works in large-scale networks.
• Large-scale Networks: The primary goal of a large-scale
network with n SD pairs is to characterize the capacity
within O(log n) in the limit of large n. In their famous
random model, Gupta and Kumar showed that nearestneighbor multi-hop routing is optimal for power-limited
networks [8]. For interference-limited networks, on the
other hand, cooperative transmission between nodes are
essentially required [9]. Notice that for both cases sources
or destinations act as relays of other SD pairs. Randomly
connected networks have been studied in [10]. It was
shown that for certain connectivity distributions the agn
gregate rate of (log n)d is achievable for some d > 0.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The degrees of freedom (DoF) of wireless networks has
received a great deal of attention as a fundamental metric in
the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In essence, DoF
characterization provides the capacity of wireless networks
within o(log(SNR)). The key issue is how to efﬁciently
manage inter-user interference in oder to achieve the optimal
DoF and there has been remarkable progress in recent years.
• Interference Networks: For interference networks or interference channels, it appears that interference alignment
is essentially required in order to achieve the optimal
DoF for more than two users. Interference alignment for
the K-user interference channel has been originally proposed by Cadambe and Jafar with signal space alignment
[1] showing that each source–destination (SD) pair can
achieve 1/2 DoF regardless of the number of SD pairs.
Other types of alignment have been proposed based on
the number theory [2] and ergodic setting [3].
• Partially Connected Interference Networks: Obviously, network connectivities can affect the DoF and one
of the important classes of partially connected networks
are layered networks. For multi-hop networks, inter-user
interference can be cancelled through multiple paths,
which is referred to as interference neutralization. For 2user 2-hop networks, aligned interference neutralization
in [4] can achieve the optimal 2 DoF. Ergodic interference
† He

From the large-scale network model perspective, any two
nodes can be connected to each other through wireless channels. In this sense, modeling large-scale networks as interference networks or partially connected interference networks
mentioned before cannot capture a potential beneﬁt of using
sources or destinations as relays of other SD pairs, which can
be seen in [8], [9]. Motivated by this aspect, we consider a
network of n SD pairs in which any two nodes are connected
to each other with a positive probability, independent of other
node pairs. For fully connected networks, i.e., connectivity
probabilities are one for all possible node pairs, direct or onehop transmission without relaying is sufﬁcient both in terms
of DoF and scaling law [11], [12]. We show that, on the other
hand, as nodes are connected more sparsely to each other,
relaying becomes a dominant strategy. We prove that, even
for arbitrarily small connectivity probabilities, each SD pair
can still achieve non-vanishing DoF in the limit of large n.

This means that very sparse connection is enough to provide
a constant fraction of DoF for each SD pair. Notice that direct
transmission with interference alignment leads to negligible
DoF as connectivity probabilities become arbitrarily small.

B. Setup
We consider a set of length-B block codes. Let Wi be the
message of source i uniformly distributed over {1, · · · , 2BRi },
where Ri is the rate of source i. A rate tuple (R1 , · · · , Rn )
is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of
(2BR1 , · · · , 2BRn ; B) codes such that the probabilities of error
for W1 to Wn converge to zero as B increases. Then, for an
achievable rate tuple (R1 , · · · , Rn ), the sum DoF of

A. Sparsely Connected Networks
We consider a network of n SD pairs. For simplicity, denote
source i and destination i by node i and node n+i respectively,
where i ∈ {1, · · · , n}.
1) Full-duplex: For full-duplex nodes, the 2n × 1 dimensional output vector at time t is given by

We ﬁrst introduce our main results here and then explain
the achievability in the next section.

Y [t] = H[t]X[t] + Z[t],

We characterize an achievable DoF for both full-duplex and
half-duplex in the limit of large n.

where H[t] is the 2n × 2n dimensional complex channel
matrix, X[t] is the 2n × 1 dimensional input vector at time
t, Z[t] is the 2n × 1 dimensional noise vector at time t. The
elements of Z[t] are independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) drawn from NC (0, 1) and each node should satisfy the
B

average power constraint P . That is, B t=1 E[|Xi [t]]|2 ] ≤ P
during B channel uses.
We assume that channel coefﬁcients vary independently over
time. Speciﬁcally, the (i, j)th element of H[t] is given by

Theorem 1 (Time-varying connectivity): Consider a network of n SD pairs with time-varying connectivity. Let
pd = minj∈{1,··· ,n} {pn+j,j } > 0. For sufﬁciently large n,

Hi,j [t] = ei,j [t]hi,j [t],

As shown in Theorem 1, for any set of non-zero connectivity
probabilities, a constant fraction of DoF is achievable for each
SD pair (at least 1/3 for full-duplex and 1/4 for half-duplex).
This result shows that vary sparse connections between nodes
is enough to guarantee non-vanishing DoF for each SD pair
even as the number of SD pairs tend to inﬁnity. For more
details, we introduce the following example.

where ei,j [t]’s are independently drawn having one with
probability pi,j ∈ (0, 1] and zero with probability 1 − pi,j
and hi,j [t]’s are again independently drawn from continuous
distributions. Hence, as the connectivity probabilities pi,j ’s
decrease, the considered network becomes more sparsely
connected. We further assume that global channel state information H[t] is available for each node at time t.
2) Half-duplex: The network model and assumptions are
the same as those of full-duplex except that each node can
either transmit or receive at a given time, but not simultaneously. Based on (1), we can deﬁne the input–output relation of
half-duplex nodes. Assuming that, at given time t, the set of
nodes N (t) ⊆ {1, · · · , 2n} transmit and the set of the rest of
nodes N (t)c = {1, · · · , 2n} \ N (t) receive, the input–output
relation is given by

direct transmission in which only a subset of sources having direct connections to their destinations send messages
through their direct channels. Then we can apply interference
alignment [2] to this one-hop transmission and each of the
corresponding SD pairs achieves 1/2 DoF. Since the number
of SD pairs having direct connections is approximately given
by np with probability approaching one as n increases,

YN (t)c [t] = HN (t) [t]XN (t) [t] + ZN (t)c [t],
where the |N (t)c | × 1 dimensional output vector at time
t is given by {Yi [t]}i∈N (t)c , the |N (t)c | × |N (t)| dimensional complex channel matrix HN (t) [t] is given by
{Hi,j [t]}i∈N (t)c ,j∈N (t) , the |N (t)| × 1 dimensional input vector at time t is given by {Xj [t]}j∈N (t) , and the |N (t)c | × 1

IV. ACHIEVABILITY
Due to the page limitation, we show the achievability
of Theorem 1 for full-duplex nodes. For simplicity, ‘with
probability one’ in this section means that the probability
approaches to one as n increases.
The achievability is based on the two-hop transmission
with decode-and-forward (DF) relaying and over each-hop we
adopt interference alignment in [2]. As shown in Example 1,
relaying is essentially required to improve DoF of sparsely
connected networks. From the result of matching in bipartite
random graphs, we can show that this two-hop transmission
with DF relying is enough to utilize a constant fraction of
nodes with probability one for each hop transmission and, as
Σ
a result, a constant fraction of dn is achievable with probability
one.

(4) with respect to p ∈ (0, 1]. As p decreases, our result
provides signiﬁcant DoF improvement compared to the direct
transmission.
B. Connectivity and DoF
The results presented in Section III-A dealt with connectivity probabilities in (0, 1], that are not scaled with n.
Obviously, if pi,j = 0, every node is isolated to each other and
dΣ
n = 0. In this subsection, we consider scalable connectivity
probabilities, i.e., the connectivity probabilities pi,j (n)’s are
functions of n. The following theorem shows a sufﬁcient
condition on pi,j (n)’s guaranteeing non-vanishing DoF for
each SD pair.

A. Matching in Bipartite Random Graphs
Before proving Theorem 1 for full-duplex, we introduce
matching in bipartite random graphs. Denote a bipartite graph
by G = (U, V, E) in which U and V are sets of vertices and
E is the set of edges. A bipartite graph G = (U, V, E) with
|U | = |V | = m is said to contain a perfect matching if for each
Ui , i ∈ {1, · · · , m}, there exists a distinguishable Vj having
an edge (Ui , Vj ). The following theorem shows the existence
of a perfect matching for a bipartite random graph in the limit
of large m.

Theorem 2 (Scalable pi,j (n)): Consider a network of n SD
pairs with time-varying connectivity. If there exist increasing
sequences ai,j (n) > 0 such that pi,j (n) = ai,j (n) log n for all
n
i, j ∈ {1, · · · , 2n}, then for sufﬁciently large n,

Theorem 4: Consider a bipartite random graph G =
(U, V, E) with |U | = |V | = m in which there is an edge
between Uj and Vi with probability qi,j ∈ (0, 1] if i = j,
independent of each other, and with probability zero otherwise.
For sufﬁciently large m, G contains a perfect matching with
probability approaching one.

is achievable with probability approaching one, where δ3,n and
δ4,n converge to zero as n increases.
This theorem shows that the connectivity probabilities can
indeed decrease slower than the order of log n while preserving
n
a constant fraction of DoF for each SD pair, independent of
n.

Proof: The overall proof is based on Theorem 3.25 in
[13]. The only differences are that qi,j are not the same and
there is no edge between Ui and Vi .

C. Static Connectivity
For static connectivity, we show that similar results presented in Section III-A still hold. In this case, once H[t] in (1)
is drawn according to (2), they remain ﬁxed during the entire
transmission. The following theorem shows an achievable DoF
for static connectivity.

B. Achievability: Time-varying Connectivity
In this subsection, we prove Theorem 1 assuming fullduplex nodes.
1) Construction of bipartite graphs: Denote pmin =
√
mini,j∈{1,··· ,2n} {pi,j } and n1 = npd − n log n, where
pd = mini∈{1,··· ,n} {pn+i,i }. Deﬁne a random variable ei,j [t]
such that P[ei,j [t] = 1] is equal to pd /pi,j if i = n + j and
pmin /pi,j otherwise. Then deﬁne the 2n × 2n dimensional
connectivity matrix E[t] such that Ei,j [t] = ei,j [t]ei,j [t]. Hence

For the ﬁrst and third blocks, i.e., t ∈ {1, · · · , B, 2B +
1, · · · , 3B}, the overall transmission at given time t can be regarded as the n-user interference channel from (S [1] [t], S [2] [t])
to (D[1] [t], M (G[d2,s2] [t])) having direct connections as shown
in Fig. 2. Similarly, for the second block, i.e., t ∈
{B + 1, · · · , 2B}, it can be regarded as the (2n − n1 )user interference channel from (S [1] [t], S [2] [t], D[2] [t]) to
(D[1] [t], M (G[s2,s2] [t]), M (G[d2,d2] [t])) having direct connections as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, by applying interference
alignment in [2] at each message transmission, 1/2 DoF is
achievable for each of message transmission.
3) Achievable DoF: For the proposed message transmission, each source or destination acts as a relay of other
SD pairs. Therefore, n[1] (l) and n[2] (l) should be carefully
chosen guaranteeing that all messages are delivered to their
ﬁnal destinations. Let ni,j (l) denote the maximum number
of messages of source j that node i can receive during the
l-th block, where i ∈ {1, · · · , 2n}, j ∈ {1, · · · , n}, and
l ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Then all messages can be delivered to their ﬁnal
destinations if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

where σ 2 = pd (1 − pd ) is a variance of En+i,i [t]. Then, by
√
log n
setting 1 =
n log n ≤ nd [t] ≤
n , we have npd −
√
npd + n log n with probability one. Hence n1 ≤ nd [t]
with probability one and, therefore, we can ﬁnd S [1] [t] with
probability one. Also, |S [2] [t]| = n−n1 → ∞ as n → ∞ with
probability one. Hence, from Theorem 4, each of G[d2,s2] [t],
G[s2,s2] [t], and G[d2,d2] [t] contains a perfect matching with
probability one. Let M (G[d2,s2] [t]) as the resulting perfect
matching set, which is the permutation set of D[2] [t] with
respect to S [2] [t]. If there are multiple matching sets, we
choose one of them uniformly at random. Similarly, deﬁne
M (G[s2,s2] [t]), and M (G[d2,d2] [t]).
For transmission, we will only use the time indices that the
connectivities satisfy the above conditions, which holds with
probability one. Hence the fractional loss on DoF becomes
negligible as n increases. For simplicity, the connectivity at
each time is assumed to satisfy the above conditions from
now on.
2) Interference alignment based on two-hop relaying: The
proposed scheme is operated over three blocks with length-B
each. Let n[1] (l) be the total number of messages transmitted
by each source when it belongs to S [1] [t] for t ∈ {(l −
1)B + 1, · · · , lB}, where l ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Similarly, let n[2] (l)
be the total number of messages transmitted by each source
when it belongs to S [2] [t] for t ∈ {(l − 1)B + 1, · · · , lB},
where l ∈ {1, 2}. Hence the total number of messages
transmitted by all sources during three blocks is given by

converges to zero as n increases.

Remark 1: The underlying approach of the proposed twohop relaying is similar to the scheme in [15]. For both cases,
at the ﬁrst phase, each node receives messages from multiple
sources when appropriate connectivities or channel gains occur
and then, at the second phase, it delivers the received messages
to the ﬁnal destinations when appropriate connectivities or
channel gains occur.
Remark 2: The relaying approach presented in this paper
is also beneﬁcial for fully connected fading networks. Consider a fully connected network in which Hi,j [t]’s are i.i.d.
drawn from NC (0, 1). If we directly apply ergodic interference
alignment in [3] fromn the sources to the destinations (oneR

hop transmission), i=1 i = 2 E 1 + 2|Hn+1,1 [1]|2 P is

achievable, where the expectation is over the channel coefﬁcient. Hence the achievable rate for each SD pair is not scaled
with n. Instead, we can construct a hypothetical connection
between two nodes if their channel gain is greater than a
certain threshold, and then apply the same two-hop relaying in
Section IV with ergodic interference alignment for each hop

R
transmission. This two-hop relaying can provide that i=1 i

scales as log log n as n increases. It was ﬁrst shown in [12]
that log log n rate scaling is achievable by ergodic interference
alignment using the channel gains greater than a threshold. We
