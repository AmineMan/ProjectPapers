that, further research focused on how to fast implement the
existing fully homomorphic schemes [29], [14], and how to
construct new homomorphic encryption schemes based on
other hard problems, such as approximate greatest common
divisor problems [8], [6] and Ring-LWE [2], [3]. As to the
cryptanalysis of homomorphic encryptions, Chen and Nguyen
[7] presented a square-root attack to break the challenges
announced in [6] successfully.
The MCG cryptosystem is a lattice-based encryption
scheme with bounded homomorphic property. This scheme
operates over vector spaces of Zp , the encryption and decryption speeds are faster than the previous homomorphic schemes.
The one-wayness of the MCG scheme relies on the hardness
of the Computational Knapsack Vector Problem (CKVP). For
the settings of recommended parameters, the known method
to recover the message is to ﬁnd a short vector in a lattice
with dimension of at least 600. In this paper, we present a
key-recovery attack on MCG by avoiding the CKVP directly.
Firstly, we uncover a hidden linear relationship between the
public keys and the private keys, then construct a reduceddimension lattice from partial public keys. Finally, we compute
the equivalent secret keys by solving the Closest Vector
Problem (CVP) of the new lattice. Our attack is more efﬁcient
than solving the CKVP. According to our experiments, all the
three scheme instances with the recommended parameters are
broken practically.
We organize the paper as follows. In Section 2, we recall
some backgrounds about lattices. Section 3 describes the MCG
lattice-based homomorphic encryption scheme. In Section 4,
we show how to attack the scheme. In section 5, experimental
results of our attack are provided. We conclude this paper in
Section 6 .

Abstract—At ISIT 2008, Aguilar Melchor, Castagnos and Gaborit presented a lattice-based homomorphic encryption scheme
(abbreviated as MCG). Its security is based on the Computational
Knapsack Vector Problem. In this paper, we explore a secret
linear relationship between the public keys and the secret keys,
which can be used to construct a reduced-dimension lattice, and
then we obtain a group of equivalent private keys by solving the
Closest Vector Problem of the lattice. Moreover, our attack is
practical on all the three settings of recommended parameters,
and the running time to recover the equivalent private keys is
only several hours on a single PC.
Key words: Lattice-based, Homomorphic encryption, Keyrecovery attack

I. I NTRODUCTION
Homomorphic encryption is an interesting concept to protect privacy, which was proposed by Rivest, Adleman and Dertouzos [26] in 1978. Since its publication, several homomorphic encryptions have been designed for the e-voting system
[5], [24], [9], private information retrieval protocol [19], [21]
and so on. Nowadays, cloud computing has become trendy in
computer science. One obstruction to cloud computing is the
loss of privacy and sensitive data. Homomorphic encryption
schemes can partially solve this problem.
Formally, a homomorphic encryption scheme can be described as follows: for two messages m1 , m2 , it satisﬁes that
Dec(En(a) ⊗ En(b)) = a ⊕ b, where ⊗ and ⊕ are two
operations over ciphertexts and plaintexts, respectively. Usually, if ⊕ represents modular addition over plaintexts, we call
the scheme additively-homomorphic. After the introduction of
privacy homomorphism, many schemes have been proposed,
such as additive homomorphic encryption schemes [16], [1],
[23], [30], [24], [9], [15], [18], [20], [25] and multiplicative
homomorphic encryption schemes [10]. At TCC’05, Boneh
et. al. [4] ﬁrstly constructed an encryption scheme permitting
both operations at the same time - this scheme handles an
arbitrary number of additions and just one multiplication. More
recently, Gentry proposed a fully homomorphic cryptosystem
based on ideal lattice which allows arbitrary times additions
and multiplications on encrypted data [11], [12], [13]. After

II. P RELIMINARIES
Let Rm be the m-dimensional Euclidean space. A lattice
n
in Rm is a discrete group L(b1 , . . . , bn ) = { i=1 xi bi :
xi ∈ Z} of all integral combinations of n linearly independent
vectors b1 , . . . , bn ∈ Rm . The integer n is called the rank of

1

the lattice L. The sequence of vectors (b1 , . . . , bn ) is called
a lattice basis, and it is conveniently represented as a matrix

5) Generate the random scrambling matrix ∆ from
GL2N (Zp ).
6) For each i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}, compute

B = (b1 , . . . , bn ) ∈ Rm×n ,

Bi = [Bi1 |Bi2 + εi ]∆ = [Pi M1 |Pi M2 + εi ]∆.

where the columns represent the base vectors. The determinant
of the lattice L is deﬁned as det(L(B)) = det(BT B).
The most famous computational hard problems on lattices
are SVP (Shortest Vector Problem) and CVP (Closest Vector
Problem).

The public key consists of matrices B0 , · · · , Bn . The private
keys are the hidden matrix M and the scrambling matrix ∆.
Encryption:
Choose a message vector m in ZN 0 and select n random dism
turbing vectors ri with coordinates in [−r0 , −r0 /2]∪[r0 /2, r0 ].
Input: a message m ∈ ZN 0 .

1) For each i ∈ {1, · · · , n}, randomly construct the disturbing vectors ri in ZN .

n
2) Compute c = mB0 + i=1 ri Bi .
Output: the ciphertext c ∈ (Z/pZ)2N .
Decryption:
Input: a ciphertext c ∈ (Z/pZ)2N .
1) Compute the unscrambled vector c = c −1 .
2) Retrieve the noise e = cD − cU M−1 M2 , where cU
1
and cD are the undisturbed and disturbed halves of c
respectively.
3) For each ei in e = [e1 , · · · , eN ], compute ei = ei − µ
with µ = ei mod q if (ei mod q) < q/2, and µ = (ei
mod q) − q, otherwise.
4) For each i ∈ {1, · · · , N }, compute mj = ej /q.
5) Return m = (m1 , · · · , mN ).
Output: the plaintext m.
One-wayness against Chosen Plaintext Attack:

Deﬁnition 1. (SVP) Given a basis of a lattice L, ﬁnd a nonzero vector u ∈ L, such that u ≤ v for any vector
v ∈ L \ 0.
Deﬁnition 2. (CVP) Given a basis B of a lattice L and a
target vector t ∈ L, ﬁnd a vector u ∈ L such that
/
u−t ≤ x−t ,
for any other x ∈ L.
Deﬁnition 3. (Successive minima) Given a lattice L with rank
n, the i-th minima λi (L) is the radius of the smallest sphere
centered in the origin containing i linearly independent lattice
vectors, i.e.,
λi (L) = inf {r : dim(span(L ∩ Bn (r))) ≥ i},
where Bn (r) represents the n-dimension ball centered at the
origin with radius r.
Deﬁne the λ2 -gap as λ2 /λ1 . Intuitively, as the gap becomes
larger, the basis reduction algorithm will work better.

Deﬁnition 4. (Computational Knapsack Vector Problem) Let
p be a large prime number. Let e and r be two integers with
e < r < p . Consider a set of n + 1 different matrices
B0 , B1 , · · · , Bn of size N × 2N . Let c be an element of the
subset

III. D ESCRIPTION OF THE MCG H OMOMORPHIC S CHEME
The notation Mn (Zp ) denotes the n × n matrices over Zp ,
and GLn (Zp ) represents the invertible matrices of Mn (Zp ).
All the operations between matrix are over Zp . For simplicity,
we omit this in the rest of our paper.
The main parameters:
The MCG scheme has ﬁve global parameters. Let N be
the number of coordinates of the plaintext vectors, and m0
represents the characteristic of the ring over which they are
constructed. The symbol l denotes the maximum number of
homomorphic operations that can be done, n represents the
number of noisy matrices in the public key, and r0 is the upper
bound for the coordinates of the random disturbing vectors
used in the encryption.
Key generation:
1) Let s0 = n × N × r0 + (N − 1) × m0 , set q = 2 × s0 ×
(2l + 1), and select a prime p such that p = q × r + s
with s < s0 .
2) Choose two random matrices M1 from GLN (Zp ) and
M2 from MN (Zp ). Denote M = [M1 |M2 ].
3) For each i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}, generate a random matrix
Pi ∈ GLN (Zp ), compute the matrix Bi = [Bi1 |Bi2 ] =
[Pi M1 |Pi M2 ].
4) For each i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}, generate a random N × N
noise matrix εi over {−1, 1}. For the matrix ε0 , multiply
each diagonal term by q.

Clearly, this problem is a generalization of the knapsack
problem. Breaking the one-wayness of the MCG scheme can
be reduced to an instance of CKVP with r = m0 and e = r0 .
To solve this instance of CKVP, the designers suggested the
following lattice spanned by the columns of (n + 3)N × ((n +
3)N + 1) matrix

Apparently, the vector
x = (m1 , · · · , mN , r11 , · · · , r1N , · · · , rn1 , · · · , rnN , 0, · · · , 0)T
is a short vector in lattice LHLP . The recommended parameters are n = 9 and N = 50, which ensure the dimension
of lattice LHLP up to 600 to resist against the lattice attack.
In this paper, we skip the CKVP and propose a key-recovery
attack for this scheme.

the columns of (n + 1)N × (n + 3)N matrix E, where E =
B pI . As the rank of lattice L reaches (n + 1)N = 500,
the existing lattice reduction algorithms can not ﬁnd a short
vector effectively.

IV. C RYPTANALYSIS OF MCG H OMOMORPHIC S CHEME
In this section, we describe the details of our attack on MCG
scheme. Firstly, we show that, there is a hidden linear relationship between the public keys and private keys. Secondly, we
construct a reduced-dimension lattice from the partial rows
of the public matrices, and then generate N CVP-instances
to recover the hidden noisy matrices. Finally, we show how
to obtain a group of equivalent private keys from the noisy
matrices.

To overcome this difﬁculty, we construct a new reduceddimension lattice
L = {y ∈ Z2N +k : y = Ax

where (2N + k) × 2N matrix A is truncated from the ﬁrst
2N + k rows of matrix B.
It is easy to verify that,

A. Linear Relationship between Public Keys and Private Keys
Theorem 1. Let B be an (n + 1)N × 2N matrix, and
P, ε be two (n + 1)N × N matrices such that B =
(B0 , B1 , · · · , Bn )T , P = (P0 , P1 , · · · , Pn )T and ε =
(ε0 , ε1 , · · · , εn )T , where the matrices Bi , Pi , εi , 0 ≤ i ≤ n
are described as above. Deﬁne lattice
(n+1)N

L = {y ∈ Z

2N

: y = Bx mod p for x ∈ Z

where ε2[1−k] is the ﬁrst k rows of ε2 . Because every
column vector of ε includes a large q, each column vector
¯
may not be the shortest vector of lattice L . In order to
remove the impact of q, we generate the target vectors as
ti = (0, 0, · · · , 0, q, 0, · · · , 0) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , q is located at
the i-th position. We expect that the i-th column vector of ε
¯
is the closest vector to target ti . The distance between ti and
L is,
√
distance(ti , L ) = 2N + k − 1.

}.

Then each column of matrix ε is a vector belongs to lattice
L.

Bi = [Pi M1 |Pi M2 + εi ]∆, i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}.

the i-th column of the noisy matrix, we can obtain the i-th
column of the bridge matrix D by solving a linear system
of equations. Furthermore, the whole noisy matrix can be
recovered by Equation (4).

Furthermore, we have

Proof: Note that,

To recall the special structure of each matrix above, each Bi
is N × 2N matrix and εi is a square matrix with dimension
N . For i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}, the elements of εi are over {−1, 1},
except each diagonal term of matrix ε0 is −q or q.

(Sdi − ti , −1)T = (εi1 , · · · , εi2N +k , −1)T ,
where εij ∈ {−1, 1} for j = i and εii = 0. The length of

each vector is 2N + k.

Next, we will prove the lattice vector with length 2N + k

is a shortest vector for all but a fraction p of the S’s.

Remark 1. Note that q is much smaller than p, so each column
of ε is a short vector of L. Obviously, lattice L is spanned by

In our attack, we invoked the lattice reduction algorithm BKZ20 [27] with reduction parameter 0.99.
In our tests, we enlarged the value k a little compared with
the estimated value in Theorem 2 to ensure the embedding
lattice would produce a bigger λ2 -gap. In order to give a
more exact estimation, we performed ten experiments for each
set of recommended parameters. To illustrate the accuracy of
the estimation of k value from Theorem 2, we summarize
the experimental data in Table 1 for the third recommended
parameters n = 9, p = 218 , q = 212 , m0 = 32, r0 = 5.
The second row of Table 1 represents the k selections that
we can successfully compute the noisy matrix for all the
ten experiments. Corresponding with the three recommended
groups of parameters, we did experiments for each instance
and summarize the gaps of the embedding lattices and the
choices of k in Table 2.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we describe a reduced-dimension attack on the
MCG homomorphic scheme. For the instances of the three sets
of recommended parameters, the equivalent private keys can
be recovered practically. The main contribution of our attack is
to explore a secret linear equation between the public keys and
the private keys, and then recover the private keys by solving
a special closest vector problem.
