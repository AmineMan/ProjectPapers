was further extended in [5] to MBIOS channels. The analyses
in [3], [4], [5] are limited to skinny trees, the height of which
is bounded by a half of the girth of the Tanner graph.
Vontobel [6] extended the decomposition of a codeword
(and pseudocodeword) to skinny trees in graph covers. This
enabled Vontobel to mitigate the limitation on the height by
the girth. The decomposition is obtained by a random walk,
and applies also to irregular Tanner graphs.
Contribution: We present a new combinatorial characterization for local-optimality of a codeword in irregular Tanner
codes with respect to any MBIOS channel. This characterization is a generalization of [4], [6], [5] and is based on a
conical combination of subtrees in the computation trees. The
main novelty is that the subtrees may have any ﬁnite height h
(even greater than the girth of the Tanner graph). In addition,
the degrees of local-code nodes are not restricted to two. We
prove that local-optimality in this new characterization implies
ML-optimality and LP-optimality. Given a codeword and the
channel output, we also show how to efﬁciently recognize if
the codeword is locally optimal.
For a ﬁxed height, trees in our new characterization contain
more vertices than a skinny-tree because the internal degrees
are bigger. Hence, over an MBIOS channel, the probability of
a locally-optimal certiﬁcate with dense deviations (local-code
node degrees bigger than two) is greater than the probability of
a locally-optimal certiﬁcate based on skinny trees (i.e., localcode nodes have degree two).
We extend the probabilistic analysis of the min-sum process
by Arora et al. [4] to a sum-min-sum process on regular
trees. For regular Tanner codes, we prove bounds on the
word error probability of LP-decoding under MBIOS channels.
These bounds are inverse doubly-exponential in the girth of
the Tanner graph. We also prove bounds on the threshold of
regular Tanner codes whose Tanner graphs have logarithmic
girth. This means that if the noise in the channel is below that
threshold, then the decoding error diminishes exponentially as
a function of the block length.
The full details and proofs in this paper are contained in [7,
Sections 3-6;8].

Abstract—Given a channel observation y and a codeword x, we
are interested in a one-sided error test that answers the questions:
is x optimal with respect to y? is it unique? A positive answer for
such a test is called a certiﬁcate for the optimality of a codeword.
We present new certiﬁcates that are based on combinatorial
characterization for local-optimality of a codeword in irregular
Tanner codes. The certiﬁcate is based on weighted normalized
trees in computation trees of the Tanner graph. These trees
may have any ﬁnite height h (even greater than the girth of
the Tanner graph). In addition, the degrees of local-code nodes
are not restricted to two (i.e., skinny trees). We prove that localoptimality in this new characterization implies ML-optimality
and LP-optimality, and show that a certiﬁcate can be computed
efﬁciently.
We apply the new local-optimality characterization to regular
Tanner codes, and prove lower bounds on the noise thresholds
of LP-decoding in MBIOS channels. When the noise is below
these lower bounds, the probability that LP-decoding fails decays
doubly exponentially in the girth of the Tanner graph.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper we deal with the problem of analyzing the
probability of successful decoding using linear-programming
(LP) decoding for Tanner codes. Tanner [1] introduced graph
representations of linear codes. In the standard setting, constraint nodes compute the parity function. In the generalized
setting, constraint nodes use a local error-correcting code.
One may view a constraint node with a linear local code
as a coalescing of multiple parity check nodes. Therefore,
a code may have a sparser and smaller representation when
represented as a Tanner code.
Wiberg [2] studied representations of codes using factor
graphs. He used these representations to analyze message
passing decoding algorithms. The analysis uses minimal combinatorial structures (now also known as skinny trees) to
characterize decoding errors when using message-passing decoding algorithms.
Koetter and Vontobel [3] analyzed LP-decoding of regular
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Their analysis is
based on decomposing each codeword (and pseudocodeword)
to a ﬁnite set of skinny trees with uniform vertex weights.
Arora et al. [4] extended the work in [3] by introducing
nonuniform weights to the vertices in the skinny trees, and
deﬁning local-optimality. For a BSC, Arora et al. proved
that local optimality implies both maximum-likelihood (ML)
optimality and LP-optimality. They used analysis techniques
similar to those used in density evolution analysis to improve
bounds on the probability of a decoding error. This work

II. P RELIMINARIES
Graph Terminology: Let G = (V, E) denote an undirected
graph. Let NG (v) denote the set of neighbors of node v ∈ V ,
and let degG (v)
|NG (v)| denote the degree of node v in
graph G. A path p = (v, . . . , u) in G is a sequence of vertices

1

such that there exists an edge between every two consecutive
nodes in the sequence p. A path p is backtrackless if every two
consecutive edges along p do not close a cycle. Let |p| denote
the number of edges in p. Let girth(G) denote the length of
the shortest cycle in G.
The subgraph of G induced by S ⊆ V consists of S and all
edges in E, both endpoints of which are contained in S. Let
GS denote the subgraph of G induced by S.
Tanner-codes and Tanner graph representation: Let G =
(V ∪J , E) denote an edge-labeled bipartite-graph, where V =
{v1 , . . . , vN } is a set of N vertices called variable nodes, and
J = {C1 , . . . , CJ } is a set of J vertices called local-code
nodes. We associate with each local-code node Cj a linear
j
J
j
C : 1 j J
code C of length degG (Cj ). Let C
denote the set of local-codes, one for each local code node.
j
We say that vi participates in C if (vi , Cj ) is an edge in E.
We view a word x = (x1 , . . . , xN ) ∈ {0, 1}N as an
assignment to variable nodes in V where xi is assigned to
vi . Let Vj denote the set NG (Cj ) ordered according to labels
of edges incident to Cj . Denote by xVj ∈ {0, 1}deg(Cj )
the projection of the word x = (x1 , . . . , xN ) onto entries
associated with Vj .
J
The Tanner code C(G, C ) based on the labeled Tanner
graph G is the set of vectors x ∈ {0, 1}N such that xVj is a
j
codeword in C for every j ∈ {1, . . . , J}. Let C j denote the
j
extension of the local code C from length deg(Cj ) to length
j
N deﬁned by C j
{x ∈ {0, 1}N | xVj ∈ C }. The Tanner
code is simply the intersection of the extensions of the local
J
codes, i.e., C(G, C ) = j∈{1,...,J} C j .

with single parity check codes acting as local codes. This
deﬁnition is based on a fundamental polytope that corresponds
to the Tanner graph G. We consider an extension of this
deﬁnition to the case in which the local codes are arbitrary
linear-codes as follows. The generalized fundamental polytope
J
J
P P(G, C ) of a Tanner code C = C(G, C ) is deﬁned by
j
P
C j ∈C J conv(C ).
Given an LLR vector λ for a received word y, LP-decoding
is deﬁned by the following linear program:
xLP (y)
ˆ

(2)

J

The difference between ML-decoding and LP-decoding is
J
that the fundamental polytope P(G, C ) may strictly contain
J
the convex hull of C. Vertices of P(G, C ) that are not
codewords of C must have fractional components and are
called pseudocodewords.
III. A C OMBINATORIAL C ERTIFICATE FOR AN ML
C ODEWORD
In this section we present combinatorial certiﬁcates for
codewords of Tanner codes that apply both to ML-decoding
and LP-decoding. A certiﬁcate is a proof that a given codeword is the unique solution of maximum-likelihood decoding
and linear-programming decoding. The certiﬁcate is based
on combinatorial weighted structures in the Tanner graph,
referred to as local conﬁgurations. These local conﬁgurations
generalize the minimal conﬁgurations (skinny trees) presented
by Vontobel [6] as extension to Arora et al. [4]. We note
that for Tanner codes, the support of each weighted local
conﬁguration is not necessarily a local valid conﬁguration.
Notation: Let y ∈ RN denote the word received from the
channel. Let λ = λ(y) denote the LLR vector for y. Let x ∈
C(G) be a candidate for xML (y) and xLP (y).
ˆ
ˆ

j

Let dj denote the minimum distance of the local code C .
J
The minimum local distance d∗ of a Tanner code C(G, C ) is
deﬁned by d∗ minj dj . We assume that d∗ ≥ 2.
If the bipartite graph is (dL , dR )-regular, i.e., the vertices
in V have degree dL and the vertices in J have degree dR ,
then the graph deﬁnes a (dL , dR )-regular Tanner code. If the
Tanner graph is sparse, i.e., |E| = O(N ), then it deﬁnes a lowdensity Tanner code. Tanner codes with single parity check
local codes that are based on sparse Tanner graphs are called
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.
LP decoding of Tanner codes over memoryless channels:
Let ci ∈ {0, 1} denote the ith transmitted binary symbol
(channel input), and let yi ∈ R denote the ith received
symbol (channel output). A memoryless binary-input outputsymmetric (MBIOS) channel is deﬁned by a conditional
probability density function f (yi |ci = a) for a ∈ {0, 1},
that satisﬁes f (yi |0) = f (−yi |1). In MBIOS channels, the
log-likelihood ratio (LLR) vector λ ∈ RN is deﬁned by
f (yi |ci =0)
λi (yi )
ln f (yi |ci =1) for every input bit i. For a code C,
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) decoding is equivalent to
xML (y) = arg min λ(y), x ,

Deﬁnition 1 (Path-Preﬁx Tree). Consider a graph G = (V, E)

and a node r ∈ V . Let V denote the set of all backtrackless
paths in G with length at most h that start at node r, and let

(p1 , p2 ) ∈ V × V p1 is a preﬁx of p2 , |p1 | + 1 =

|p2 | . We identify the empty path in V with (r). Denote by
h
ˆ , E) the path-preﬁx tree of G rooted at node r
ˆ
Tr (G) (V
with height h.
Path preﬁx trees of G that are rooted in variable nodes are
often called computation trees. We consider also path preﬁx
trees of subgraphs that may be either rooted at a variable node
or at a local-code node.
We use the following notation. Because vertices in Trh (G)
are paths in G, we denote vertices in path-preﬁx trees by p
ˆ
and q. Vertices in G are denoted by u, v, r. For a path p ∈ V ,
let t(p) denote the last vertex (target) of path p. Denote by
Preﬁx+ (p) the set of proper preﬁxes of the path p, i.e.,

(1)

Preﬁx+ (p) = q

q is a preﬁx of p, 1

are called variable paths, and paths in J are called local-code
paths.
The following deﬁnitions expand the combinatorial notion
of minimal valid deviations [2] and weighted minimal localdeviations (skinny trees) [4], [6] to the case of Tanner codes.

Based on random walks on the Tanner graph, the result of
Vontobel [6] implies that (h, w, 2)-local optimality is sufﬁcient
both for ML-optimality and LP-optimality. The random walks
are deﬁned in terms derived from the generalized fundamental
polytope. We extend the results of Vontobel [6] to “thicker”
sub-trees by using combinatorial arguments on graphs and
the properties of graph cover decoding [10]. Speciﬁcally, we
prove that (h, w, d)-local optimality, for any 2
d
d∗ ,
implies both ML- and LP-optimality (Theorems 5 and 10).
Given the decomposition of Lemma 11 proved in Section V,
the following theorem can be obtained by modiﬁcation of the
proof of [4, Theorem 2] or [5, Theorem 6].

Deﬁnition 2 (d-tree). Consider a Tanner graph G = (V ∪
ˆ
ˆ ˆ
J , E). Denote by Tr2h (G) = (V ∪ J , E) the path-preﬁx tree
of G rooted at node r ∈ V. A subtree T ⊆ Tr2h (G) is a dtree if: (i) T is rooted at (r), (ii) for every local-code path
ˆ
p ∈ T ∩ J , degT (p) = d, and (iii) for every variable path
ˆ
p ∈ T ∩ V, degT (p) = degTr2h (p).
Let T [r, 2h, d](G) denote the set of all d-trees rooted at r
that are subtrees of Tr2h (G).
In the following deﬁnition we use “level” weights w =
(w1 , . . . , wh ) that are assigned to variable paths in a subtree
of a path-preﬁx tree of height 2h.

Theorem 5 (local-optimality is sufﬁcient for ML). Let λ ∈
RN denote the LLR vector received from the channel. If x
is an (h, w, d)-locally optimal codeword w.r.t. λ and some

d
d∗ , then x is also the unique maximum-likelihood
codeword w.r.t. λ.

A. Local Optimality Implies LP-Optimality
In order to prove a sufﬁcient condition for LP optimality,
we consider graph cover decoding introduced by Vontobel and
Koetter [10]. We note that the characterization of graph cover
decoding and its connection to LP decoding can be extended
to the case of Tanner codes in the generalized setting.
We use the terms and notation of Vontobel and Koetter [10]
in the statements of Proposition 6 and Lemma 9. Speciﬁcally,
˜
˜
let G denote an M -cover of G. Let x = x↑M ∈ C(G) and

. We refer to wT as a w-weighted subtree.

For any w-weighted subtree wT of Tr2h (G), let πG,T ,w :
V → R denote a function whose values correspond to the
projection of wT to the Tanner graph G. That is, for every
variable node v in G,
πG,T ,w (v)

wT (p).

Proposition 6 (local-optimality of all-zero codeword is preserved by M -lifts). 0N is an (h, w, d)-locally optimal codeword for λ ∈ RN if and only if 0N ·M is an (h, w, d)-locally

optimal codeword w.r.t. λ.

For a word x ∈ {0, 1}N , let (−1)x ∈ {±1}N denote a

y ∗ z (y1 · z1 , . . . , yN · zN ).

For two vectors x ∈ {0, 1}N and f ∈ [0, 1]N , let x ⊕ f ∈
[0, 1]N denote the relative point deﬁned by (x ⊕ f )i |xi −
fi | [8].
From this point forward, let G = (V∪J , E) denote a Tanner
graph, and let C(G) ⊂ {0, 1}N denote a Tanner code based on
G with minimum local distance d∗ . Let w = (w1 , . . . , wh ) ∈
Rh \ {0h } denote a non-negative weight vector for some
+
positive integer h ∈ N+ and let 2 d d∗ .
The following deﬁnition is an extension of localoptimality [4], [6] to Tanner codes on memoryless channels.

The following proposition states that the mapping (x, λ) →
(0N , (−1)x ∗ λ) preserves local optimality.
Proposition 8 (symmetry of local-optimality). For every x ∈
C, x is (h, w, d)-locally optimal for λ if and only if 0N is

The following theorem is obtained as a corollary of Theorem 5 and Lemma 9. The proof is based on arguments utilizing
properties of graph cover decoding. Those arguments are used

for a reduction from ML-optimality to LP-optimality similar
to the reduction presented in the proof of [5, Theorem 8].

Throughout this section, let C(G) denote a Tanner code with
minimum local distance d∗ , let x denote a nonzero codeword,
h
let h ∈ N+ , and let w ∈ R+ \ {0h }.

Theorem 10 (local optimality is sufﬁcient for LP optimality).
If x is an (h, w, d)-locally optimal codeword w.r.t. λ, then x
is also the unique optimal LP solution given λ.

Lemma 11. Consider a codeword x = 0N . Then, for every
2 d d∗ , there exists a distribution ρ over d-trees of G of
height 2h such that for every weight vector w ∈ Rh \ {0h },
+
it holds that
x = x 1 · Eρ πG,T ,w .

IV. V ERIFYING L OCAL O PTIMALITY
In this section we address the problem of how to verify
whether a codeword x is (h, w, d)-locally optimal with respect
to λ. By Proposition 8, this is equivalent to verifying whether
0N is (h, w, d)-locally optimal with respect to (−1)x ∗ λ.
The veriﬁcation algorithm is listed as Algorithm 1. It
applies dynamic programming to ﬁnd, for every variable
node v, a d-tree Tv , rooted at v, that minimizes the cost
(−1)x ∗ λ, πG,Tv ,w . The algorithm returns false if and only
if it ﬁnds a deviation with nonpositive cost.
The algorithm is presented as a message passing algorithm.
In every step, a node propagates to its parent the minimum cost
of the d-subtree that hangs from it based on the minimum
values received from its children. The time and message
complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(|E| · h). The following
notation is used in Line 8 of the algorithm. For a set S of real
values, let min[i] {S} denote the ith smallest member in S.

The proof of Lemma 11 is outlined in this section and
is based on Lemmas 12–13 and Corollary 14. Lemma 12
states that every codeword x ∈ C(G) can be decomposed into
a set of weighted path-preﬁx trees. The number of trees in
the decomposition equals x 1 . Lemma 13 states that every
weighted path-preﬁx tree is a convex combination of weighted
d-trees. This lemma implies that the projection of a weighted
path-preﬁx tree equals to the expectation of projections of
weighted d-trees (Corollary 14).
For a codeword x ∈ C(G), let Vx
{v ∈ V | xv = 1}.
Let Gx denote the subgraph of G induced by Vx ∪ N (Vx ).

Proof sketch: If xv = 0, then πG,Tr2h (Gx ),w (v) = 0. It
remains to show that equality holds for variable nodes v ∈ Vx .
Consider a uniform weight vector η = 1h . Then, for every
1 i 2h, the accumulated contribution of all the path-preﬁx

projecting the path-preﬁx trees {Tr (Gx ) : xr = 1} to the
base graph G.
Lemma 13. Consider a subgraph Gx of a Tanner graph G,
where x ∈ C(G)\{0N }. Then, for every variable node r ∈ Gx ,
every positive integer h, every 2 d d∗ , and every weight
vector w ∈ Rh , it holds that

wTr2h (Gx ) = Eρr wT
where ρr is the uniform distribution over T [r, 2h, d](Gx ).
Proof sketch: The lemma follows by showing that the
uniform distribution over w-weighted d-trees has the property
that the expectation of trees over the distribution equals
wTr2h (Gx ) .
The following corollary follows Lemma 13 and linearity of
expectation.

on linear combination of subtrees in the computation trees.
These trees may have any degree d in the local-code nodes, for
2 d d∗ . This increased degree enables each subtree to be
larger than a skinny tree. The bounds on the probability that
a local-optimality certiﬁcate exists for regular Tanner codes
show that the larger a subtree is in the decomposition, the
higher the probability that a certiﬁcate exists.
The error correction capability of expander codes depends
on the expansion, thus a fairly large degree and huge blocklengths are required to achieve good error correction. Feldman
and Stein [11] analyzed LP decoding of (2, dR )-regular expander codes. In the case of code rate of 0.375, they proved
that LP-decoding can recover any pattern of at most 0.0008N
bit ﬂips (with dR
16). The best results for iterative decoding
of expander codes, reported by Skachek and Roth [12], implies
correction of at most 0.0016N bit ﬂips. These analyses yield
overly pessimistic predictions for the average-case (i.e., the
BSC). Theorem 16(2) deals with average case analysis and
implies that LP-decoding can correct up to 0.044N bit ﬂips
with high probability. Furthermore, previous iterative decoding
algorithms for expander Tanner codes deal only with bitﬂipping channels. Our analysis for LP-decoding applies to
any MBIOS channel, in particular, it can be applied to the
BI-AWGN channel.
The lower bounds on the noise threshold proved for Tanner
codes do not improve the best previous bounds for regular
LDPC codes. An open question is whether using deviations
denser than skinny trees for Tanner codes can beat the best
previous bounds for regular LDPC codes [4], [5]. In particular,
1
for a concrete family of Tanner codes with rate 2 , it would
be interesting to prove lower bounds on the threshold of LPdecoding that are larger than p∗ = 0.05 in the case of BSC,
and σ ∗ = 0.0735 in the case of BI-AWGN channel.

LP-D ECODING U SING L OCAL -O PTIMALITY
Due to lack of space, we only state the main result of
this section for a concrete case and the BSC (Theorem 16).
Concrete bounds are given for a (2, 16)-regular Tanner code
with code rate at least 0.375 when using [16, 11, 4]-extended
Hamming codes as local codes. We refer the reader to [7,
Section 8] for further details and the case of general regular
Tanner codes over BSC and MBIOS channels.
Theorem 16. Let G denote a (2, 16)-regular bipartite graph
with girth g, and let C(G) denote a Tanner code based on
G with minimum local distance d∗ = 4. Let x ∈ C(G) be a
codeword. Suppose that y ∈ {0, 1}N is obtained from x by
ﬂipping every bit independently with probability p. Then,
1) [ﬁnite length bound] Let d = d0 and p
p0 . For the
values of d0 and p0 in Table I it holds that x is the unique
optimal solution to the LP decoder with a probability of

VII. C ONCLUSIONS AND D ISCUSSION
A new combinatorial characterization for local optimality
of a codeword in an irregular Tanner code is presented.
This characterization provides an ML-certiﬁcate and an LPcertiﬁcate for a given codeword. Moreover, the certiﬁcate can
be efﬁciently computed by a dynamic programming algorithm.
The main novelty in this characterization is that it is based
