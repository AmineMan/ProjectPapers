is achieved. But in this case the symbol rate 1/Ts is upper
bounded by the so-called Nyquist rate, which is equal to B
(note that we consider complex symbol here). Moreover, the
Nyquist rate can only be achieved when the unpractical sinc
pulse is employed. This means for NS the only way to improve
the spectral efﬁciency is to use larger symbol alphabets.
An alternative way for bandwidth efﬁcient modulation is
faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, which was introduced in
1970’s [1]. The original idea of FTN is to reduce Ts from
TN to τ TN , τ < 1, i.e. increasing the symbol rate to get a
higher information rate, and keep the performance degradation
acceptable. Although ISI is unavoidable in FTN, symbols can
be detected via sequence detection [2] or equalization. It has
been shown that for typical T-orthogonal pulses the minimum
Euclidean distance dmin of FTN signals is not reduced until
τ is less than a threshold τM < 1, e.g. τM = 0.802 for
sinc pulse [1]. τM is called Mazo Limit, which is a classic
parameter in FTN research since the probability of error of
uncoded transmission is dominated by dmin in high-SNR
regime. However, for a long time FTN didn’t attract much
attention, even some negative opinion was reported [3]. This
is partially because its detection complexity, but a perhaps
more important reason is that there was a lack of motivation to
replace NS by this more complex technique, especially when
we can approach AWGN channel capacity within a few tenths
of a decibel by capacity-achieving codes. In recent years,
Rusek and Anderson [4] showed that FTN often has capacity
gains relative to NS because it can utilize the excess bandwidth
from any practical pulse shaping but NS can not. So NS is in
fact suboptimal. The capacity of FTN, however, is the same
as the waveform channel capacity if it “fast” enough. Their
researches give FTN an undoubted value.
In FTN researches, however, the design of the modulation
pulse was rarely considered. Moreover, only T-orthogonal
pulses were employed. When ISI is unavoidable, the pulse
can be seen as a channel code. A carefully designed pulse
is beneﬁcial to performance and detection complexity. The Torthogonal assumption, whose original motivation is only to
avoid ISI in NS, is a completely unnecessary constraint for
pulse design and is irrelevant to the capacity gain of FTN. So
a generalized version of FTN with pulse design as its important
research topic is needed, and this is the motivation of our work.
In this paper we discard the T-orthogonal assumption and
consider the problem of faster-than-Nyquist signaling with ar-

Abstract—We extend the concept of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN)
signaling to linear digital modulation using arbitrary modulation
pulses, called generalized faster-than-Nyquist signaling (GFTN).
A universal deﬁnition of nominal bandwidth is given so that
“how fast” can be measured for GFTN like FTN using Torthogonal pulses. The capacities and their asymptotic behaviors
are compared between GFTN and Nyquist signaling. We show
that the gain of GFTN increases unboundedly with SNR. In high
SNR regime the power gain is considerable. Our extension from
FTN to GFTN gives more freedom on the design of pulses to
achieve good performance and acceptable detection complexity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
This paper considers the problem of transmitting a linear
digital modulation signal s(t) over additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) channel. The baseband equivalent model is
r(t) = s(t) + w(t)
∑
=
x[n]g(t − nTs ) + w(t)

(1)

n

where w(t) is the white Gaussian noise, x[n] is a sequence
of independent and uniformly distributed symbols drawn from
a complex-valued alphabet X with size |X |, g(t) is a ﬁniteenergy modulation pulse, typically real and continuous. Moreover, g(t) is assumed to be time-limited and approximately
band-limited. Time-limited means g(t) vanishes outside a
ﬁnite number of symbol intervals, say [0, LTs ]. Approximately
band-limited means the energy outside a ﬁnite frequency
interval is lower than a predeﬁned threshold ε, which is
negligibly small. We consider only baseband equivalent model,
so assume that the frequency interval is B = [−B/2, B/2], i.e.
the bandwidth of g(t) is B. Then the power spectrum density
(PSD) of s(t) is
2

2

|S(f )| = (Es /Ts ) |G(f )|

(2)

2

where Es is the symbol energy, |G(f )| is the PSD of g(t)
∫
2
normalized as B |G(f )| df = Ts . So the PSD of s(t) is
determined by g(t) and the bandwidth of s(t) is also B.
In most cases Nyquist signaling (NS) is used in (1), i.e.
choose g(t) to be a “T-orthogonal” pulse gN (t) such as sinc
pulse and root raise cosine (RRC) pulses whose Ts -sampled
autocorrelation function

h[k] =
g(t)g(t − kTs )dt, k ∈ Z

satisﬁes h[k] = δ[k]. Then if we set Ts = TN and use a match
ﬁlter receiver, intersymbol interference (ISI) free transmission

where PN is the power of the noise component that projected
onto the signal vector s(t) in Euclidean signal space, i.e. the
part of noise that really affect the performance. This is another
property of our nominal bandwidth deﬁnition.
Since the model of GFTN is available, now the problem
of dmin computation can also be considered like traditional
FTN research, but the difference is the Mazo limit phenomena
may not exist in some cases. More study is not involved here
as the computation method has been well established in the
literature, e.g. [5]. Even if dmin holds, the distance distribution
will always change when τ is reduced. So GFTN can be seen
as a channel code with a coding gain (although it is in fact
negative according to match ﬁlter bound [1]) or inner code for
coded input sequences. We deﬁne its code rate as rG = 1/τ . If
we have a bit rate R over B the spectral efﬁciency is thus η =
R/B. Typically R = r/Ts = rbin · log2 |X |/Ts , where r is the
average number of information bits carried by a symbol, rbin is
the rate of binary-coding. For a GFTN system, the overall code
rate is r · rG , we call it nominal spectral efﬁciency, denoted as
ηnom . Thus ηnom = r/W Ts = R/W . We deﬁne bandwidth
excess as β = (B − W )/W . For T-orthogonal pulses the roll
off α equals to β , but for arbitrary pulses their relationship is
uncertain. Then η = ηnom /(1+β) . So η is proportional to rG ,
i.e. inversely proportional to τ , and β introduces some spectral
efﬁciency penalty. When β → 0, η → ηnom . In summary,

bitrary pulses, called generalized faster-than-Nyquist (GFTN)
signaling whose model is given in Section II-A based on a
universal deﬁnition of nominal bandwidth. Then we focus on
the detection complexity and capacity gain of GFTN given in
section II-B and III respectively. Section III also gives results
of the capacity asymptotic behaviors of some GFTN examples
with comparison to NS. In Section IV we discuss the design
of GFTN with emphasis on pulse design. The conclusion is
given in the last section.

When we consider a generalized version of FTN which
employs arbitrary pulses, a benchmark is needed to measure
the relative signaling rate to NS, like the function of TN for
FTN. But we can hardly ﬁnd it for non-T-orthogonal pulses
in time domain. We know that for NS the nominal bandwidth
is deﬁned to be the complex symbol rate W = 1/TN . So the
function of W is the same as TN for FTN. We generally deﬁne
the nominal bandwidth for linear digital modulation signals
with modulation pulse g(t) as

The nominal bandwidth deﬁnition of NS is a special case of
ours, which can be veriﬁed according to the PSD band-edge

B. The Optimal Detection of GFTN and Its Complexity
The optimal sequence detector of linear digital modulation
signals with ISI (includes GFTN as a special case) is given in
[2]. Here we introduce it brieﬂy to analyze the factors affect
detection complexity.
First, from the Ts -spaced sampling of the output of a match
ﬁlter g(LTs − t) for r(t), a set of sufﬁcient statistics to detect
x[n] is obtained which denoted as a sequence y[n] called
Ungerboeck observation, given by
∫ ∞
y[n] =
r(t)g(t − nTs )dt
−∞
(10)
∑∞
=
x[m]h[n − m] + v[n]
m=0
∫∞
where v[n] = −∞ w(t)g(t − nTs )dt, h[k] has been deﬁned
in section I. Then a information-lossless whiten ﬁlter can be
used to y[n] to get the Forney observation model
∑∞
u[n] =
x[m]b[n − m] + w[n]
(11)

(6)

(6) is a basic corollary of Nyquist criterion. Note that practical
Nyquist systems usually use pulses with α < 0.3 .
Now we can give the model of generalized faster-thanNyquist signaling as
(
∑
τ )
s(t) =
x[n]g t − n
, τ <1
(7)
n
W
where the symbol interval Ts equals τ /W . GFTN includes
any linear digital modulation signals with a symbol rate larger
than its nominal bandwidth. Evidently, FTN is a special case.
Moreover, partial response signaling (PRS) which maybe the
only well-known non-Nyquist systems are also special cases.
In the model (7) g(t) can be arbitrary pulses as we described
at the beginning of this section. But in the rest of the paper
only roll off pulses will be considered which satisfy |G(f )| =
|G(0)| = max |G(f )|, f ∈ [−(1 − α)B/2, (1 − α)B/2]. The

m=0

where b[n] is a causal ISI tap sequence satisﬁes that its
autocorrelation is h[k].
(11) is evidently a convolution model. It’s well known that it
can be solved by maximal likelihood sequence detection with
Viterbi algorithm. Recall that the time duration of g(t) is LTs ,
we have h[k] = 0, |k| ≥ L. Moreover, h[k] ̸= 0, |k| < L is
always true for pulses not carefully designed. So the number

f

reason will be given in section III. Thus our deﬁnition of
nominal bandwidth is the same as the deﬁnition of equivalent
noise bandwidth of ﬁlters:

of the non-zero ISI taps is L − 1, which is deﬁned as the ISI
memory length denoted by ν. Thus the trellis diagram of the
ν
ISI convolution model has |X | states with |X | branches each.
So the trellis complexity of the optimal detection of GFTN is
ψ(ν, |X |) = |X |

ν+log2 |X |

An important corollary of (18) is that when rG ≥ 1 + β
we have CG = Cw > CN with the same PSD and power
constraints [4]. Thus all possible capacity gain is obtained.
Note that rG ≥ 1 + β implies Ts ≤ 1/B, so this corollary
tells us when the sampling rate of receiver (i.e. the symbol
rate of GFTN) exceed the Nyquist sampling rate of g(t) the
capacity of the waveform channel can be fully utilized. But
higher rG doesn’t increase capacity.
In fact, even rG is lower than 1 + β, in most cases CG
is still larger than CN , and CG often increases monotonically
with rG [6]. However, since 1+β is typically at most only 1.3,
it’s reasonable to set rG ≥ 1 + β. We assume this condition
holds in the rest of the paper.

III. O N T HE C APACITY OF GFTN
A. Capacity Results
Rusek and Anderson analyze the capacity of FTN and the
effects of input constraints as well as signaling rate [4,6]. Their
methods hold for GFTN. So in this subsection we only cover
the main results brieﬂy.
For an ideal band-limited AWGN channel, i.e. the frequency
domain channel response is a rectangular (or brick-wall)
spectrum, the ultimate channel capacity is
C = B log(1 + P/N0 B)

B. The Capacity Gains of GFTN and Its Limits
In this subsection the capacity gains of GFTN are analyzed.
All proofs are omitted because of the limited space.

where Bi = {f : |Gi (f )|2 > 0} and µ(Bi ) is its Lebesgue
measure.
Theorem 1: Deﬁne the capacity gain of GFTN as (CG −
CN )/CN , Then the asymptotic capacity gain of GFTN relative
to NS with the same bandwidth and power constraints is β
when P → ∞ or 0 when P → 0.
Corollary 1: For the same bandwidth and power constraints,
the capacity of GFTN can approach the capacity of an ideal
band-limited AWGN channel asymptotically, i.e. GFTN is
asymptotic optimal.
We point that [4] had given a theorem which is essentially
the same as corollary 1.
Theorem 2 (the limit of the capacity gain of GFTN): The
asymptotic relative capacity gain of GFTN relative to NS with
the same PSD and power constraints satisﬁes 0 < µ < β for
any SNR.
All above results can be interpreted as the view of capacity
spectrum density (CSD) C(f ) = log(1+P |G(f )|2 /N0 ). Since
log(1 + x) → x, when x → 0, in low SNR regime the
channel is power-limited, the shape of CSD approaches the
shape of PSD. Since log(1 + ax)/ log(1 + bx) → 1 when
x → ∞, in high SNR regime the channel is bandwidth limited,
the shape of CSD approaches shape of rectangular, and thus
the capacity differences from different pulses asymptotically
disappear. Now we can interpret why we consider only roll off
pulses in GFTN research: a PSD near rectangular spectrum is
better, and a small α is preferred.
Theorem 3 (the absolute asymptotic capacity loss of GFTN):
When P → ∞ the capacity loss∫ of GFTN to ideal AWGN
channel approaches a constant − B log B|G(f )|2 df .
Corollary 1 can also be derived from this theorem.

(15)

It’s independent of gN (t) used. CN (β) < Cw (GN (f )) is
always true except when gN (t) is sinc pulse. So Cw (GN (f ))
can be seen as the “practical” capacity and NS is always
suboptimal.
Now we consider the capacity of a linear digital modulation
system, denoted as CLM , where GFTN is a special case. CLM
can be obtained from the capacity of its equivalent discrete
time model (e.g. its Forney observation model) denoted as
CDT by CLM = CDT /Ts . CDT is [7]

Next we omit the superscript and denote Gnorm (f ) brieﬂy as
G(f ). The G(f ) that maximize Cw (G(f )) and makes it equal
to C in (13) is just the non-practical rectangular spectrum (sinc
pulse in time domain) according to water-ﬁlling theorem. The

C. Examples about the capacity asymptotic behaviors

The normalized capacity asymptotic behaviors

obtained in high SNR regime, especially power gains. For
example, at η = 8 bit/s/Hz, the power gain of the ﬁrst GFTN
example to NS example with α = 0.3 is as large as 10 dB! In
fact, the power gains as well as capacity gains are unbounded.
Fig. 4 shows the interesting asymptotic behaviors of normalized capacities, where all capacities are normalized to the
capacity of ideal band-limited AWGN channel. Many results
mentioned above are clearer in this style. Moreover, we found
that for each GFTN example there exists a certain SNR in low
SNR regime correspond to a lowest normalized capacity.

Now we give some examples about the asymptotic behaviors
of GFTN and NS with given PSDs, since a general analysis
on arbitrary PSDs is difﬁcult and unnecessary. For NS we use
classic RC PSDs with α = 0.1 and α = 0.3. For GFTN the
PSDs comes from cosn (f ) windows. When n = 1

IV. O N T HE D ESIGN OF GFTN
Unlike traditional FTN researches, this paper emphasizes
the idea that to optimize GFTN system via pulse design. It’s
not only very important to reduce the detection complexity,
but also helpful to achieve the waveform channel capacity.
From (12), the detection complexity ψ of GFTN is determined by |X | and ν. For a certain η as a design target
we can adjust |X | and rG (to adjust ν) to minimize ψ. The
logarithm of |X | is proportional to η. ν is determined by the
actual length of g(t), say Tg , and the symbol interval Ts , i.e.
ν = L − 1 = ⌈Tg /Ts ⌉ − 1 where ⌈a⌉ is the minimum integer
larger than a. Recall that Ts = 1/W rG and η ∝ rG , so ν
is roughly proportional to η for given Tg or proportional to
Tg for given η. A linear increase of either Tg or η will cause
ν
an exponentially increase of ψ. So |X | is roughly ﬁxed for

Its nominal bandwidth is 0.5B. It’s often called Hann. window,
which is in fact a RC pulse with α = 1. At last the ideal bandlimited AWGN channel with rectangular PSD is included as
a benchmark. All PSD examples are shown in Fig. 1. We see
that the PSDs of GFTN examples are not only far from ideal
rectangular PSD, but even worse than NS examples.
The capacity computation results are given in Fig. 2 and Fig.
3 for relatively low and high SNR regime respectively. We note
that the SNR in the ﬁgures mean P/N0 B, not P/N0 WENB .
It is shown that in relatively low SNR regime, the capacities
of GFTN increase faster than NS’s. Although the PSDs of
GFTN are worse than NS’s, moderate to high gains are

given η and Tg . Then from (12), a smaller |X | (which causes
larger ν or rG for given η) may leads to smaller complexity.
For further complexity reduction, a natural idea is to design
pulses with smaller Tg for ﬁxed B. We deﬁne the actual
time bandwidth product (TBP) of pulse as γ = Tg B. The
lowest complexity can be obtained by ﬁnd a pulse with
smallest γ subject to a energy leakage ε in frequency domain,
since γ cannot be arbitrary small according to the uncertainty
principle. Slepian, Landau and Pollak introduced the method
to generate such pulses from prolate spheroidal wave functions
(PSWF) [8,9]. Note that the classic TBP deﬁnition is based
on root mean square bandwidth and duration but not the
same as ours, so the smallest classic TBP pulse, Gaussian
waveform, is not the best solution of our problem. From [9],
a pulse generated by PSWF with γ from 2 to 3 is sufﬁcient
to make ε small enough. For example, set β = 1, rG = 2, i.e.
1/Ts = B, then ν = 2 can be obtained. This can hardly be
obtained in FTN systems employing RRC pulses. A larger η
may cause larger ν, but it’s still the smallest possible value.
Moreover, in practice some suboptimal algorithms such as
the truncated Viterbi algorithm can be used for the tradeoff
between performance and complexity.
Another idea for complexity reduction is to ﬁnd g(t) satisﬁes
h[k] = 0, ν + 1 ≥ |k| ≥ νe + 1
(23)

algorithm is used to reduce the detection complexity of FTN.
But this example is still not very practical (encode block
length 10000 symbols, 35 iterations, some error ﬂoor). Using
techniques introduced in this section, more practical schemes
based on GFTN are expected to achieve.
At last we point that for all above pulse design guidelines
the shape of its PSD should be considered as a constraint.
It affects the capacity penalty relative to ideal band-limited
AWGN channel. Thanks to the capacity asymptotic behavior,
higher SNR leads to smaller penalty and gives pulse design
more freedom. So the PSD is in fact a “soft constraint”.

via carefully pulse design, where νe can be called effective
ISI memory length. The actual complexity is then

In this paper, we introduce generalized faster-than-Nyquist
signaling to utilize the capacity of excess bandwidth, which
maybe the ﬁnal potential of typical point-to-point channels.
Our extension from FTN to GFTN gives more freedom to
the design of pulses for good performance and acceptable
detection complexity. GFTN is especially valuable in high
SNR regime where we can do more freely pulse design with
little capacity cost and considerable power gains can still be
obtained. GFTN with carefully designed concatenation coding
and iterative decoding can be a valuable bandwidth efﬁcient
transmission technique in future.

a νe strictly less than ν reduces complexity. For example, we
can choose the so-called duobinary pulse used in traditional
PRS systems as g(t), which satisﬁes

for 1/Ts = B, i.e. rG = 1 + β. Although γ is not considered,
νe = 1 is obtained. This may better than when PSWF-style
pulse is used. This kind of GFTN can be seen as a PRS
system but with different design philosophy. However, PRSstyle pulses achieve νe < ν only for rG = 1 + β. A slightly
larger rG can be achieved with some approximations, e.g. [10].
A more complete and accurate view of GFTN pulse design
is to treat the pulse as a rate-1 convolutional inner code
and design turbo-like concatenated coding schemes. The code
design is a more complex topic and we don’t discuss it
in depth here. Typically, when a carefully designed rate-1
precoder without spectrum broadening is introduced in the
turbo-like coding scheme, the waveform channel capacity can
be approached, usually with acceptable detection complexity
[11]. Then the target of the pulse design is no longer only
complexity reduction, and techniques from modern coding
theory are emphasized. A design example based on FTN with
ηnorm = 2bit/s/Hz operates below the Shannon limit of NS
with the same PSD had been given in [12]. Truncated Viterbi
