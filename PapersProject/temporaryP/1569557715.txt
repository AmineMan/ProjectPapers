the Welch bound, then C is called a maximum-Welch-boundequality (MWBE) codebook [2].
The MWBE codebook, also known as an equiangular
tight frame [3], has been of interest in many research areas,
e.g., synchronous code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems [4], Grassmanian packings [5], compressed sensing [6],
and quantum computing [7]. Unfortunately, constructing an
MWBE codebook in an analytic way is known to be extremely
difﬁcult [2]. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to
present a near-optimal codebook C, where Imax (C) asymptotically achieves the Welch bound equality for sufﬁciently large
N . A number of construction examples based on codes and
signal sets can be found in [2]. Ding and Feng [8][9] also presented several near-optimal codebooks from almost difference
sets. Generalizing this idea, Zhang and Feng [10][11] further
constructed near-optimal codebooks with almost difference
sets and cyclotomic classes. Recently, the author of this paper
constructed near-optimal partial Fourier and Hadamard codebooks [12] associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences [13].
This paper presents a new class of near-optimal (N, K)
partial Fourier codebooks, where N = K 2 − 1 and K = 2k
for a positive integer k. We create a K × N partial Fourier
matrix by selecting K rows from the N × N inverse discrete
Fourier transform (IDFT) matrix, where each code vector of
a codebook C is equivalent to a column of the partial matrix.
Exploiting the array structure of binary m-sequences of period
N , we determine a set of the selected row indices for C.
Moreover, it is found that the row index set for C is a union
of several cyclotomic cosets modulo N . A theoretical study
of the codebook C shows that the magnitude of inner products
between distinct code vectors is two-valued, and its maximum
nearly achieves the Welch bound equality for sufﬁciently large
N . Therefore, C is a new near-optimal codebook or nearly
equiangular tight frame with N = K 2 − 1, which may ﬁnd its
potential applications in many research ﬁelds.

Abstract—A codebook, or equivalently a frame, has many
applications in communications, signal processing, and quantum
computing. In the applications, it is required that the maximum
magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code
vectors should meet the Welch bound equality strictly or asymptotically. In this paper, a new (N, K) codebook is constructed
from a K × N partial Fourier matrix with N = K 2 − 1 and
K = 2k for a positive integer k, where each code vector is
equivalent to a column of the matrix. To obtain the K ×N partial
Fourier matrix, K rows are selected from the N × N inverse
discrete Fourier transform matrix, where a set of the selected row
indices is determined from the structure of binary m-sequences
of period N . Through a theoretical study, it is found that the
magnitude of inner products between distinct code vectors is
two-valued, and its maximum nearly achieves the Welch bound
equality. The new near-optimal codebook, equivalent to a nearly
equiangular tight frame, can ﬁnd its potential applications in
deterministic compressed sensing.

I. I NTRODUCTION
An (N, K) codebook C = {c0 , · · · , cN −1 } is a set of N
distinct code vectors in a K-dimensional vector space. Each
code vector cl = (cl,0 , · · · , cl,K−1 )T , 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, has
K−1

2
unit-norm, i.e., ||cl || =
i=0 |cl,i | = 1, where T denotes
the transpose. For the applications, we need a codebook C
minimizing Imax (C) or the maximum magnitude of inner
products between a pair of distinct code vectors. To evaluate
an (N, K) codebook C, it is therefore important to ﬁnd the
minimum achievable Imax (C) or its lower bound. The Welch
bound [1] provides

Imax (C) =

C. Binary m-sequences
1) Deﬁnition: A binary m-sequence is a class of binary sequences with ideal two-level autocorrelation [15]−[17], which
is a characteristic sequence of a cyclic difference set [18].
Let a = (a0 , · · · , a2m −2 ) be a binary m-sequence of period
2m − 1, where at ∈ Z2 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2m − 2. Then, its (periodic)

We believe that Proposition 1 has been implicitly known
to many researchers in this ﬁeld, where its proof is straightforward from Corollary 1 in [12]. Proposition 1 implies that
a binary m-sequence of period N = 2m − 1 has the ﬂat
spectrum of the N -point IDFT at its nonzero indices, where

III. A N EAR - OPTIMAL C ODEBOOK FROM THE A RRAY
S TRUCTURE OF B INARY m- SEQUENCES
The following notations are used throughout this paper.
− k is a positive integer and m = 2k.
− N = 2m − 1, M = 2k − 1, d = N/M = 2k + 1, and
K = 2k .
− α is a primitive element in F2m and β = αd is a
primitive element in F2k .
− ev is an integer determined by (3), where 0 ≤ ev ≤
2k − 2.

Algebraically, a binary m-sequence of period 2m − 1 is
represented by a single-term trace function [16][17], i.e.,
t = 0, 1, · · · , 2m − 2

(3)

where 0 ≤ ev ≤ 2k − 2. From (2) and (3), it is easily checked
that the binary m-sequence a has a (2k − 1) × (2k + 1) array
structure with row index i and column index v [17]. In the
array, the ﬁrst column sequence of v = 0 is all zero sequence
of length 2k −1, while the vth column sequence for 1 ≤ v ≤ 2k
is a cyclic ev -shift of a binary m-sequence of period 2k − 1,
represented by Trk β i+ev for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2k − 2.

3) Fourier transforms of binary m-sequences: Let a =

transform (IDFT) of a is deﬁned as a = (a0 , · · · , aN −1 ) with

order to select the corresponding rows from the N -point IDFT

We can check that changing a primitive polynomial or
primitive element α in F2m yields different index sets in
Lemma 2. Note that the m
number of primitive polynomials over
F2 of degree m is φ(2 m−1) [17], where φ(x) is the Eulertotient function denoting the number of integers from 1 to x
which are relatively prime to x. Therefore,m
employing different
primitive polynomials, we obtain total φ(2 m−1) different index
sets for given m = 2k. Moreover, each index set R has its
cyclic equivalence class of R + τ = {rv + τ | rv ∈ R} for
0 ≤ τ ≤ 2m − 2, which does not change the corresponding Imax (C). m
Consequently, Construction 1 presents at most
(2m − 1) · φ(2 m−1) partial Fourier codebooks nearly achieving
the Welch bound equality.

Example 1: Let k = 3 and m = 6. Let α be a primitive
element in F26 , which is a root of primitive polynomial x6 +
x + 1. Then, cyclotomic cosets modulo 9 partitioning Z+ are
9
C1 = {1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5} and C3 = {3, 6} from which the set
of nonzero coset leaders is Γ2 (9) = {1, 3}. With u1 = 1,
(7) becomes αz1 = 1 + α7 = α26 from which z1 = 26.
Therefore, a cyclotomic coset modulo 63 associated with C1
is C13 = {13, 26, 52, 41, 19, 38}, where s1 = 13. Similarly,
with u2 = 3, we have αz2 = 1 + α21 = α42 , so z2 = 42.
Thus, associated with C3 , C21 = {21, 42}, where s2 = 21.
Finally, the index set is given by

Theorem 1: In the (N, K) codebook C from Construction 1,

Remark 1: In theory and practice, an (N, K) MWBE codebook C (or equiangular tight frame) with N = K 2 is of
1
particular interest, where Imax (C) = √K+1 . Xia et al. [19]
showed that an (N, K) partial Fourier codebook is MWBE if
and only if cyclic difference sets [18] are used for selecting the
K rows from the N -point IDFT matrix. In this case, however,
the parameter N is at most N = K 2 − K + 1 for given K. To
obtain a codebook with N = K 2 , one may employ a K × K 2
discrete-chirp matrix [20], or equivalently the Alltop-Garbor
frame [5][21], which turns out to be a near-optimal codebook
C achieving Imax (C) = √1 for a prime integer K.
K
In addition to the well known codebooks, Construction 1
presents a new near-optimal (N, K) partial Fourier codebook
C achieving Imax (C) = √1 , where the parameters are N =
K
K 2 − 1 and K = 2k for a positive integer k. We believe
that the new partial Fourier codebook, equivalent to a nearly
equiangular tight frame, may be of interest in many research
ﬁelds, by meeting the Welch bound equality asymptotically
and providing composite parameters of N and K.

Remark 2: The near-optimal partial Fourier codebook in
Construction 1 has been generalized in [22] for K = pk and
N = K 2 − 1 for any prime p and a positive integer k. In
the generalized codebook, the magnitude of inner products
between distinct code vectors is also two-valued, and its maximum nearly achieves the Welch bound equality. Therefore,
a larger number of near-optimal codebooks with various K
and N can be presented by the generalization. In [22], it
is also shown that the row index set forms a new almost
difference set [23] for any prime p, and the near-optimality
of the codebook is established through the almost difference
set. Moreover, it turns out that each element of the index set is
obtained by a decimation of an N -ary Sidelnikov sequence [13]
of length N with decimation factor K − 1. For more details
on the generalization, see [22].
IV. C ONCLUSION
This paper has presented a new near-optimal (N, K) partial
Fourier codebook C, where N = K 2 − 1 and K = 2k
for a positive integer k. To determine a set of the selected
row indices for C, we exploited the spectral decomposition
of binary m-sequences with the array structure. A theoretical
study of Fourier transforms showed that the magnitude of inner
products between distinct code vectors in C is two-valued and
Imax (C) = √1 nearly achieves the Welch bound equality.
K
With the near-optimal Imax (C) and the composite parameters
of N and K, the new partial Fourier codebook C may ﬁnd
its potential applications in many research areas, particularly
in deterministic compressed sensing where a tight frame with
nearly optimal coherence [24] is required for a sensing matrix.
