structure of the quantization process, usually leads to a loose
lower bound especially in the high SNR regime, it provides
a good approximation in the low SNR regime. In fact many
previous results (such as the 2/𝜋 result) can be re-proved in
a substantially easier and more elegant way. Moreover, we
extensively handle the 1-bit case with noise correlation and
show that depending on the correlation structure of the noise,
the low SNR capacity loss can be higher or smaller than 2/𝜋
compared to the unquantized case. Surprisingly, we observed
that even for simple SIMO channels with 1-bit output, the
mutual information achieved by QPSK can be exceeded.
Our paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
general system model. In Sections III and IV, an (approximate)
lower bound of the mutual information with Gaussian input
is derived based on the Bussgang decomposition. Finally, we
handle the 1-bit symmetric quantizer case in more detail in
Section V.

Abstract— We investigate the effect of quantization on the
performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels
in terms of achievable communication rates. To this end, we
derive a lower bound on the channel capacity of quantized MIMO
channels based on the Bussgang decomposition. The work is of
interest in the case when low resolution A/D-converters (ADCs)
have to be used to enable higher sampling rate and to simplify
the hardware. An essential aspect of our derivation is that we
take into account possible noise correlation. The low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) analysis of the special case of 1-bit quantization
reveals that noise correlation might reduce the capacity loss due
to quantization when compared to the uncorrelated noise case,
where it is well known that the capacity decreases by the factor
2/𝜋 after the 1-bit quantization at low SNR.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In future multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, low power and low cost are becoming key
requirements. Among other things, it is desirable to reduce the
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution in order to save
power and chip area [1]. In fact, in high speed systems the
sampling/conversion power may reach values in the order of
the processing power. Therefore, coarse ADCs, acting as lowresolution scalar quantizers, may be a cost-effective solution
for such applications, especially when the array size becomes
very large or when the sampling rate becomes very high (in the
GHz range) [2]. Unfortunately, most of the contributions on
MIMO communications assume that the receiver has access
to the channel data with inﬁnite precision. In [3], [4], the
effects of 1-bit quantization are studied from an information
theoretical point of view for MIMO systems, where the
channel is perfectly known at the receiver and the noise is
uncorrelated. It turns out that the well known reduction of low
SNR channel capacity by factor 2/𝜋 due to 1-bit quantization
holds also for the general MIMO case with uncorrelated noise.
In [5], the non-coherent MIMO channel was studied in detail
and a similar conclusion has been made. On the other hand,
[6] and [7] showed that the channel capacity loss due to
the 1-bit quantization of the single-input single-output (SISO)
AWGN channel can be reduced at low SNR by using a 1-bit
asymmetric quantizer or by oversampling, while [8] studied
the SISO capacity problem with multi-bit quantization.
In this work, we provided a lower bound on the channel
capacity based on the Bussgang decomposition [9] of the
quantized output for the general case of correlated noise.
Although this simple method, which neglects the deterministic

where 𝒚 is the unquantized receive vector of dimension 𝑁 ,
𝑯 ∈ ℂ 𝑁 ×𝑀 is the channel matrix and 𝒙 is the unknown data
vector, while 𝜼 is an i.i.d. Gaussian noise with covariance matrix 𝑹 𝜂𝜂 . The operator 𝑄(⋅) represents the scalar quantization
process, where the real parts 𝑦 𝑖,𝑅 and the imaginary parts 𝑦 𝑖,𝐼
of each signal component 𝑦 𝑖 is mapped to a quantized value
from a ﬁnite set of code words as follows
𝑟 𝑖,𝑐 = 𝑄(𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 ), if 𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 ∈ [𝑟lo , 𝑟up ), 𝑐 ∈ {𝑅, 𝐼}, 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑁.

quantization is motivated by the fact that vector quantization
is rather uncommon for ADC implementations.
Our goal is to derive a lower bound on the achievable
rates, where we assume for analytical tractability a Gaussian
input distribution. Evidently, this distribution is not necessarily
the capacity achieving distribution and just provides a lower
bound for it. The analysis that follows considers the case
where perfect channel state (𝑯 and 𝑹 𝜂𝜂 ) is available at
the receiver, which is principally possible even with coarse
quantization [10]. However, the presented framework can be
applied independently of the kind of channel state information
at the transmitter.

Next, we introduce a new MIMO Gaussian channel that is
described by the same effective channel matrix 𝑯 ′ and the
same effective noise covariance matrix
𝒓 𝐺 = 𝑯 ′ 𝒙 + 𝜼 𝐺,

(10)

but differs from the original channel by the fact, that the noise
vector 𝜼 𝐺 is Gaussian distributed with the same covariance
matrix 𝑹 𝜂′ 𝜂′ = E[𝜼 𝐺 𝜼 H ]. In [11], it was shown that, for
𝐺
a given noise covariance matrix (known at the receiver), the
Gaussian distributed noise minimizes the mutual information,
which leads to the following lower bound
𝐼(𝒙; 𝒓) ≥ 𝐼(𝒙; 𝒓 𝐺 ).

(11)

𝐼(𝒙; 𝒓 𝐺 ) corresponds to the mutual information of the MIMO
Gaussian channel, that reads as
𝐼(𝒙; 𝒓 𝐺 ) = log2 1 𝑁 + 𝑹−1𝜂′ 𝑯 ′ 𝑹 𝑥𝑥 𝑯 ′H ,
𝜂′
Fig. 1.

when the channel input 𝒙 is Gaussian distributed with the
covariance matrix 𝑹 𝑥𝑥 . Again, 𝑯 ′ and 𝑹 𝜂′ 𝜂′ are given in (8)
and (9) respectively.
Now, the main difﬁculty consists of deriving the covariance
matrices 𝑹 𝑟𝑟 and 𝑹 𝑟𝑦 assuming a Gaussian input. For the
1-bit quantizer, these matrices can be found in a closed form
(see Section V). However, for general scalar quantizers, we
get an approximate evaluation, which will be described in the
following section.

which are for instance valid for a uniform or non-uniform
quantizer minimizing the mean square error (distortion) between the input 𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 and the output 𝑟 𝑖,𝑐 . Obviously, Eq. (17)
follows from Eqs (13) and (16). Assuming now that the
channel input is Gaussian then the quantizer input signals
𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 are Gaussian distributed and thus, they undergo the same

distortion factor 𝜌 𝑞 , i.e., 𝜌 𝑞
optimal parameters of the uniform as well as the non-uniform
quantizer and the resulting distortion factor 𝜌 𝑞 for Gaussian
distributed signals are tabulated in [12] for different bit resolutions 𝑏. Recent research work on the optimal quantization
of a Gaussian source can be found in [13], [14], [15]. Now,
let 𝑞 𝑖 = 𝑞 𝑖,𝑅 + 𝑗𝑞 𝑖,𝐼 be the complex quantization error. Under
the assumption of uncorrelated real and imaginary part of 𝑦 𝑖 ,
we obtain:

In summary, using (25), the effective channel from (8) becomes

(29)
while the effective noise covariance matrix from (9) can be
obtained by means of (25) and (28)

In this section, we deal with the special case of symmetric
1-bit quantization, where, fortunately, the required correlation
matrices can be obtained in an exact way. In fact, it is
known from the classical arcsine law [17] that the output of a
decision device 𝑟 𝑖,𝑐 = sign[𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 ] ∈ {−1, 1} has the following

Finally, the lower bound on the mutual information of the 1bit quantized MIMO channel with Gaussian input is computed
from (12).
Again, we can consider the low SNR regime where 𝑹 𝑦𝑦 ≈
𝑹 𝜂𝜂 to obtain the following asymptotic lower bound of the
mutual information

parametrized by the noise correlation factor 𝑟 fulﬁlling ∣𝑟∣ ≤
1. Further, the power of the scalar input is denoted by
𝑃 = E[∣𝑥∣2 ]. For the case 𝑟 = −1 (the two noise components are oppositely correlated), and under 1-bit quantization,
the obtained lower bound on the mutual information with
Gaussian input is shown in Fig. 2 as function of the input
power. Interestingly, the lower bound exhibits a non-monotonic
behavior with respect to the signal power (i.e. the SNR),
which leads to the conclusion that noise might be favorable
for the mutual information of quantized output channel. For
comparison, the achievable rate of the same channel with
QPSK input is depicted. It can be shown that this corresponds
to the capacity of two parallel erasure channels with an erasure

(44)

We can observe that for certain range of the input power,
the Gaussian symbol alphabet can achieve higher mutual
information than the QPSK schemes despite of the 1-bit output
quantization. Other numerical experiments shows that this
interesting phenomenon usually occurs in quantized MIMO
channels, where the number of outputs exceed the number of
inputs.
Next, Fig. 3 shows, for the same channel, the ratio of the low
SNR mutual information with 1-bit output to the one without
quantization as function of the noise correlation coefﬁcient 𝑟.
Thereby, we make use of the asymptotic value of the mutual
information from (41) as well as the approximation given in
(34) with 𝜌 𝑞 = 1 − 2/𝜋. First of all, the delivered approximation seems to be accurate when the correlation factor is
