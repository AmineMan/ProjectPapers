Abstract—We present models for authentication in biometric settings. We could determine the trade-off between falseacceptance exponents and the so-called privacy-leakage rate. In
this way we extend the Ahlswede-Csiszar secret-key generation
result [1993] and more speciﬁcally the secret-key rate vs. privacyleakage rate trade-off, studied by Ignatenko and Willems [2009].

XN

Ahlswede and Csiszar [2] investigated a secret-key generation model in which a message is exchanged between two
terminals that only contains a negligible amount of information
about the secret. The terminals are observing the outputs of
correlated sources and want to generate a common secret. This
setting forms the foundation of template-protection systems,
e.g. the fuzzy commitment system proposed by Juels and Wattenberg [11]. We have the objective here to analyze secret-key
generation in an authentication setting, i.e., we are interested
in ﬁnding out what false-acceptance rate can by achieved by
an imposter that has access to the exchanged message. The
Ahlswede-Csiszar model was studied by the authors in [9]
to determine the trade-off between the secret-key rate and
the amount of information that the exchanged message leaks
about biometric sequence (privacy leakage). We will extend
this trade-off to authentication here.

The system should be designed such that the FRR is negligible

authenticated, he presents his (legitimate) sequence Y N to
the authenticator. Also an impostor can try to get positively
authenticated. To accomplish this, he has to present a sequence
Z N to the authenticator, that results into a positive authentication decision. Thus, we assume here that the impostor can
perform an active attack (i.e. inject some sequence) only before
authentication point (or matching point), see Ratha et. al [13],
by trying to make use of the operational vulnerability of a
system.
The authenticator uses a set B(XY ) ∈ X N × Y N and

an encoder that sends an index F ∈ F = {1, 2, · · · , |F|} to

in this rate-constrained setting to constrain the storage rate

exponential behavior of the mFAR given that the FRR is
negligible.
The authenticator now uses a set B(F Y ) ∈ F × Y N and

C. Discussion

∆

The result that we have obtained is not a surprise considering Stein’s lemma, see Csiszar and Korner [5].
The major disadvantage of this basic authentication system
is that the enrollment sequence has to be communicated to and
stored securely at the authenticator. Otherwise, an impostor
can gain access to X N and then get positively authenticated
easily. To prevent this, the enrollment sequence X N has to
be encrypted for storage and communication and decrypted
for authentication, since the authenticator needs the original
X N . All this requires the use of an extra key management
mechanisms.

R ≥ I(U ; X),
for P (u, x, y) = Q(x, y)P (u|x)}.
Proof: (a) In the achievability part we transform N copies
of the source (X, Y ) into a source (F, Y N ) with (roughly)
H(Y N |F ) ≤ N H(Y |U ) and F ∈ {1, 2, · · · , |F|} with
|F| ≈ 2N I(U ;X) , hence F is a quantized version of X N , see
Ahlswede and Korner [3]. On this new source we apply the
achievability part of basic Thm. 1. (b) The converse part is an
extension of the converse of the basic theorem.

The advantage of constraining the storage rate is that we
have to transmit, store, and encrypt/decrypt less data than
in the basic setting. Note that taking U ≡ X results in

legitimate person presents his biometric sequence X N ﬁrst to

E = I(X; Y ) and R = H(X), which is the result for the
basic setting. Again, just like in the basic setting, F has to be
encrypted and decrypted.
Note that our Thm. 2 is similar to but yet different from the
result on one-sided rate constrained hypothesis testing in [1].

A secret-key based authentication system.

We are investigating a so-called secret-key based authentication system. Observe that the secret S that is sent to the
equality-checker should be secured using cryptographic techniques. Crucial is that we do not have to encrypt and decrypt
the secret S here. It is possible to apply a one-way function on
both the enrollment secret S and the estimated secret Sy or Sz
and check equality in the encrypted domain. This technique is
also used for traditional password authentication.
It is also of interest that the same false-acceptance exponent
for the basic setting is also achievable with secret-based
authentication.
The investigated scheme is an extension of the AhlswedeCsiszar [2] model in which no impostor is present. The relation
between mutual information and reliabilities was investigated
by Ho [7] and in Ho and Verdu [8]. Strengthening the secrecy
constraint from weak to strong does not lead to Thm. 3.

The scenario for secret-based authentication will be described next. During enrollment a person presents his biometric sequence X N to an encoder. From this enrollment
sequence X N a secret S is generated. This secret is made
available at some later time to the authenticator, which is just
an equality-checker here, see Fig.3. The encoder also produces
a helper message M that is stored in a public database. To get
authenticated the legitimate person presents his authentication
sequence Y N to a decoder. The decoder produces an estimated
secret Sy using the helper message M , that it can retrieve
from the public database. Also an impostor can try to get
positively authenticated. An impostor who has access to the
helper message M too, can present an impostor sequence
Z N (M ) to the decoder that now forms estimated secret Sz
using M . The equality-checker compares the estimated secret
Sy or Sz to the enrolled secret S, and positively authenticates a
person if the secrets are equal and rejects a person, otherwise.
The secret-key based system must be designed such that the
mFAR is exponentially as small as possible, while we require
FRR to be negligible.

Note that in our achievability proof we must demonstrate
that there exist encoders and decoders that (a) achieve the
FRR constraint (11), and that (b) guarantee that the mFAR
constraint (12) is met for E = I(X; Y ).

V. ACHIEVABILITY P ROOF T HM . 3

The encoder can be described by the encoding function
(S, M ) = e(X N ), where S ∈ {φe , 1, 2, · · · , |S|} is the
generated secret and M ∈ {1, 2, · · · , |M|} the public helper
message. Here φe is the secret-value if the encoder could
not assign a secret. The decoder operations are given by
Sy = d(M, Y N ), where Sy ∈ {φd , 1, 2, · · · , |S|} is the
estimated secret. Now φd is the estimated secret-value if
the decoder could not ﬁnd an estimated secret. Note that an
impostor can choose Z N = i(M ), depending on the helper
data M . This impostor sequence z N ∈ Y N is then presented
to the decoder that forms Sz = d(M, Z N ) = d(M, i(M )). The
equality-checker compares the output of the encoder, i.e. the
secret S, to the output of the decoder, i.e. the estimated secret

Slepian-Wolf coding situation.

First we show that there exist a (Slepian-Wolf) code for
reconstruction of X N by the decoder, see Fig. 4. This code
deﬁnes the M -labeling. Fix ε > 0 and N , and consider the
typical set AN (XY ).
ε
To each xN ∈ X N a label m that is uniformly chosen from
{1, 2, · · · , M} is assigned. Denote this label by m(xN ). Upon

observing xN the encoder sends m(xN ) to the decoder. The
decoder chooses the unique xN such that m(xN ) = m(xN )
and (xN , y N ) ∈ AN (XY ). If such an xN cannot be found,
ε
the decoder declares an error. It is not important what value
xN gets in that case.
Averaged over the ensemble of M -labelings, the error probability is smaller than or equal to 2ε, for N large enough, when
|M| = 2N (H(X|Y )+3ε) , hence there exists an M -labeling with

Next assume that an S-labeling used by the encoder during

xN ∈ AN (X), and s(xN ) = φe for xN ∈ AN (X). Moreover

FRR and the upper bound (17) on the mFAR, results in the
achievability of E = I(X; Y ).
VI. CONVERSE T HM . 3
We will show that for all encoders and decoders that achieve
the FRR constraint (11), there is at least one impostor such that
the mFAR constraint (12) is not satisﬁed for E > I(X; Y ).

C(m) = {s : there exists an y N such that d(m, y N ) = s},
(18)
hence C(m) is the set of secrets that can be reconstructed from
m. Moreover let C(·, ·) be a function of s and m, such that
C(s, m) = 1 for s ∈ C(m) and C(s, m) = 0 otherwise. Now

(15)

Now consider an m ∈ M. An impostor, knowing the helper
message m, tries to pick a sequence z N such that the resulting
estimated secret Sz equals the secret key S of the person he
claims to be. The impostor, knowing m, can decide for the
most promising secret-key Sz and then choose z N that results,
together with m, in this most promising key. The impostor,
knowing m, need only consider secrets Sz that result from
typical sequences, i.e. from xN ∈ A(m). Other sequences can
not be output of the SW-decoder.
For each m, we distribute all sequences xN ∈ A(m)
roughly uniform over s-labels. All non-typical sequences get
label φe . The number of typical sequences with label m is
upper bounded by Pr{M = m}/2−N (H(X)+ε) . Distributing
these sequences over all s-labels uniformly leads to at most
Pr{M = m}/(2−N (H(X)+ε) |S|) typical sequences having
a certain secret label.
The joint probability that m occurs and an impostor, knowing m, chooses the correct secret, is therefore upper-bounded

An impostor chooses, knowing m, a target secret sz ∈ C(m)

Note that the result found here coincides with the corresponding result in [9] and also in [10], if we replace secret-key
rate with false-acceptance exponent. There is also a connection
to Csiszar and Narayan [6], who considered the secret-key rate

We extended the secret-key generation biometric scenario
by considering false-acceptance rates. We found the fundamental limits and trade-offs for the false-acceptance exponents.
These exponents are equal to the known secret-key rates.
Cardinalities of auxiliary alphabets are easy to obtain but not
considered here. Also the secret-key rate as a parameter is not
considered here. Limiting the privacy-leakage rate is similar to
bounding the rate of message M . It is obvious that the falseacceptance exponent cannot exceed the secret-key rate. Wang
et al. [12] investigated biometric systems with a focus on the
trade-off between both the FRR and mFAR exponents.

If we now let δ ↓ 0 and N → ∞ then since Pr{Sy = S} ≤ δ,
and P (C = 1) ≥ 1 − Pr{Sy = S} ≥ 1 − δ, we get that for
achievable false-acceptance exponents E ≤ I(X; Y ).

demonstrates the achievability of E = I(X; Y ) that
I(X N ; M ) ≤ H(M ) ≤ log2 |M| = N (H(X|Y ) + 3ε). (26)
