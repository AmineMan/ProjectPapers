tree search algorithm with ML performance in the receiver
unit that is based on depth-ﬁrst search strategy in sphere
decoding method for polar codes. Secondly, we simpliﬁed
the proposed method by the help of an encoding property
of polar coding. By this way, the search tree can be split
up two independent parallel trees with reduced depths. It has
been shown in [9] that the conventional sphere decoding for
space-time block codes reduces the expected complexity from
exponential to polynomial (roughly in cubic). The idea of the
sphere decoding algorithm is ﬁrst introduced by Fincke and
Phost in [10] as a method for the shortest vector problem in
a lattice. Later, it is adapted to efﬁcient decoders for lattice
codes in [11] and space-time block codes of multiple antenna
systems in [12] and [13]. We focused on code based fast sphere
decoding algorithms to reduce not only expected, but also
worst-case decoding complexities [14]–[16]. Our motivation
is about to develop polar code structure based fast optimal
sphere decoding algorithm for various block lengths. In this
work we only consider small block lengths that are N ≤ 64.
Moreover, our method can also be applied for relatively long
block lengths.
Polar codes are identiﬁed as P (N, K), where K is the
dimension such that 0 ≤ K ≤ N . Noting that GF (2) denotes
the Galois ﬁeld of two elements, an algebraic description of
polar codes is given as a matrix product in GF (2)

Abstract—Polar codes are known as the ﬁrst provable code construction to achieve Shannon capacity for arbitrary symmetric
binary-input channels. Although, there exist efﬁcient sub-optimal
decoders with reduced complexity for polar codes, the complexity
of the optimum ML decoder increases exponentially. Hence the
optimum decoder is infeasible for the practical implementation
of polar coding. In this paper, our motivation is about developing
efﬁcient ML decoder with reduced complexity. In this purpose,
polar code based sphere decoding algorithm is proposed with the
optimal performance. Additionally, proposed technique exploits
two properties of polar coding to reduce decoding complexity.
By this way, the reduced complexity of optimal decoding is only
cubic, not exponential.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The polar codes are the ﬁrst provable class of codes to
achieve Shannon capacity for binary symmetric channels [1].
This can be obtained by encoders and decoders with the
complexity of O(N log N ), namely quasilinear in terms of the
block length N = 2n , where n is the number of polarization
steps. In spite of low complexity in encoder and decoder units
of polar codes, the corresponding decoders have sub-optimal
performances. It is also reported in [1] and [2] that successivecancellation (SC) decoder performs block-error probability as
β
Pe ≤ 2−N for any β < 0.5 making use of the quasilinear
complexity. The generalization of SC decoder is described for
polar codes in [3]. In this case, it can be shown that the
performance suffers from sub-optimality of the SC decoder
for short polar codes. Additionally, another efﬁcient and suboptimal decoder for polar codes, the belief propagation (BP)
decoder, is introduced [4]. The performance of polar codes
and Reed-Muller (RM) codes are investigated and an efﬁcient
implementation of BP decoder for polar codes is presented
in [5]. Accordingly, it is reported in [6] that the performance
of BP is signiﬁcantly better than SC decoding over the binary
erasure channel (BEC). However, this is not true for the binaryinput additive white Gaussian noise channel (BAWGNC) [6].
To investigate the performance of polar codes under ML
decoding, Viterbi algorithm based ML decoder for short polar
codes are implemented in [7]. Unfortunately in polar coding,
decoding complexity increases exponentially to get the ML
performance [8]. In this work, ﬁrstly, we propose an efﬁcient

x = dF ⊗n ,

(1)

where F ⊗n is the nth Kronecker power of F = 1 0 . Here,
1 1
transmitted bits and corresponding codewords are represented
by d = (d0 , . . . , dN −1 ) and x = (x0 , . . . , xN −1 ), respectively.

The considered search tree in the proposed method is depicted
in Fig.1 as a search graph. There are black nodes that are able
to produce at least one child node (black or grey) inside the
sphere. Contrarily, grey nodes are unproductive nodes. The
software implementation of the pseudocode is available online
[17]. The decoding complexity of the proposed algorithm is
polynomial (roughly in cubic [9]) for short polar codes and
also RM codes.

II. P ROPOSED O PTIMAL D ECODER FOR P OLAR C ODES
As a well known iterative receiving process, the sphere
decoding algorithm is an efﬁcient search method with optimal
error performance. Brieﬂy, in the ﬁrst step of the algorithm,
the sphere decoder assumes a sphere with a center point at
1
2 S + 1 which depends on the received noisy vector in
N −dimensional space. Then, a constraint is imposed for all
possible data sequence d as the requirement to be inside of
a sphere which is given in the following expression,

and variance σ 2 . X is the column vector with BPSK modulated
signals for encoded bits in x, {“1” → +1, “0” → −1}. The

An analysis of the channel polarization rule is beyond the
scope of this paper. Reader may ﬁnd the detailed description
in [1]. Additionally, heuristic construction method is also given
in [4], and [7]. There are N − K = 3 input bits that are ﬁxed
to zero. These are also called as frozen bits, d0,2,4 = 0. The
other K = 5 bits d = (d1 , d3 , d5 , d6 , d7 ) are data dependent.

Proposed search tree for (8,5) polar code on BPSK channel.

A. Code Based Complexity Reduction on Proposed Decoder
To obtain more complexity reduction we consider that
encoding structure of polar coding can be exploited without
any performance loss. In this purpose we notice that dN −1
and related (N − 1)th row [ 1 0 . . . 1 0 ] of F ⊗n can be
used to reduce the complexity of the proposed search tree in
(13). Using property of (N − 1)th row, we can apply parallel
two separated search processes. By this way, N −dimensional
proposed search process can be split up two independent
(N − 1)−dimensional search processes that can be parallel
implemented without any performance loss.
In parallel process-1, let we assume d6 = 0 for P(8,5), the
equation (4) can be written as

performances under ML estimation. Moreover, frame-errorrates (FERs) are ﬁgured in Fig.5-6. Proposed methods in this
paper and Viterbi based method in [7] perform same ML
performances. Fortunately, we can show that the expected
complexity is cubic for the proposed method, whereas Viterbi
based method has exponential complexity. In the sphere decoding algorithm, expected number of node visitings may be used
as expected complexity, whereas complexity per node visiting
increases by the level of the node. Additionally, the full trial
set is used for the exhaustive search decoder. We presume
that the expected complexity of the proposed algorithm and
the exhaustive search decoder can be given as the average
number of node visitings for the target BER=10−2 , 10−3 and
10−4 . Simulation results are given in Table.1 suggest that
signiﬁcant complexity reduction can be obtained by the code
based efﬁcient decoding method and the proposed algorithm
for the polar codes is up to 2 times faster than for RM codes.
Additionally, signiﬁcant reduction of the expected decoding
complexities of P(64,57) and RM(64,57) are shown in Fig.4
as the number of node visitings for EbN0.

IV. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we introduce a new approach that is sphere
decoding to implement efﬁcient ML decoding techniques for
polar codes. In this case, sphere decoding based proposed
algorithms are ﬁrstly considered for polar codes with the
optimal error performance. Additionally, a signiﬁcant complexity reduction is obtained by the proposed methods. Firstly,
it is shown that the complexity of the optimal decoder is
only cubic, not exponential. Secondly, it is observed that the
decoding complexity of polar codes is lower than RM codes
under the proposed algorithm while the optimal performance
is guaranteed. Consequently, we show that polar codes have
fast decodable properties. In polar coding, there are two useful
properties on decoding complexity that are high number of
zeros in the generator matrix and encoding scheme property
for parallel search trees.

III. P ERFORMANCE AND C OMPLEXITY R ESULTS
In this section, we give some simulation results to evaluate
the expected decoding complexities and the attained ML error
performances of the proposed methods for the short polar and
RM codes. Firstly, we investigate the error performances under
ML estimation of the RM and polar codes for (64,57) by the
use of proposed method. In this case, bit-error-rates (BERs)
are ﬁgured in Fig.2 that RM(64,57) does better than P(64,57)
at optimal performances. These results are also reported in [7]
that RM code has better error performance due to its hamming
distance based construction. Additionally, it is ﬁgured in
Fig.3 that RM(32,26) and P(32,26) achieve equivalent error
