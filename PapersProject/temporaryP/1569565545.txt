Instantaneous sampling corresponds to vectors ai that are
canonical base vectors.
Measurements can also be given in terms of the Fourier
transform of the signal:

Abstract—We study the problem of sampling a random signal
with sparse support in frequency domain. Shannon famously
considered a scheme that instantaneously samples the signal at
equispaced times. He proved that the signal can be reconstructed
as long as the sampling rate exceeds twice the bandwidth (Nyquist
rate). Cand` s, Romberg, Tao introduced a scheme that acquires
e
instantaneous samples of the signal at random times. They proved
that the signal can be uniquely and efﬁciently reconstructed,
provided the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the
signal, times logarithmic factors.
In this paper we consider a probabilistic model for the signal,
and a sampling scheme inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in
coding theory. Namely, we propose to acquire non-instantaneous
samples at random times. Mathematically, this is implemented by
acquiring a small random subset of Gabor coefﬁcients. We show
empirically that this scheme achieves correct reconstruction as
soon as the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the
signal, thus reaching the information theoretic limit.

B. Information theory model

In [4], Cand` s, Romberg, Tao studied a randomized scheme
e
that samples the signal instantaneously at uniformly random
times. Mathematically, this corresponds to choosing the measurement vectors ai to be a random subset of the canonical
basis in Cn . They proved that, with high probability, these
measurements allow to reconstruct x uniquely and efﬁciently,
provided m C|S| log n, where S = {! 2 ⌦ : x(!) 6= 0} is

In this paper, we consider a probabilistic model for the
signal x, namely we assume that the components x(!), ! 2 ⌦

information theoretic thinking has led to impressive progress in
digital communication, as demonstrated by the development of
modern iterative codes [14]. More broadly, probabilistic models can lead to better understanding of limits and assumptions
in relevant applications to digital communication and sampling
theory.

A. Deﬁnitions
For the sake of simplicity, we consider a discrete-time model
(analogous to the one of [4]) and denote signals in time
domain as x 2 Cn , x = (x(t))1tn = (x(1), . . . , x(n))T .
Their discrete Fourier transform is denoted by x 2 Cn ,

for a complex variable z, z is the complex conjugate of z.

C. Related work
Following [4] that considers a discrete-time model, the
author in [3] studied the sampling problem for multi band,
spectrum-sparse continuous-time signals and showed that blind
reconstruction near Landau rate is possible with high probability.
The sampling scheme developed here is inspired by the idea
of spatial coupling, that recently proved successful in coding
theory [7], [16], [10], [11] and was introduced to compressed
sensing by Kudekar and Pﬁster [9]. The basic idea, in this
context, is to use suitable band diagonal sensing matrices.
Krzakala et al. [8] showed that, using the appropriate message passing reconstruction algorithm, and ‘spatially-coupled’
sensing matrices, a random k-sparse signal x 2 Rn can be
b
recovered from k+o(n) measurements. This is a surprising result, given that standard compressed sensing methods achieve
successful recovery from ⇥(k log(n/k)) measurements.

The results of [8] were based on statistical mechanics methods and numerical simulations. A rigorous proof was provided
in [5] using approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms
[6] and the analysis tools provided by state evolution [6],
[2]. Indeed, [5] proved a more general result. Consider a
non-random sequence of signals x(n) 2 Rn indexed by the

analytically tractable avenue. Our method can be thought of as
a subsampling of a discretized Gabor transform of the signal.
In [13], Gabor frames have also been used to exploit the
sparsity of signals in time and enable sampling multipulse
signals at sub-Nyquist rates.
II. S AMPLING SCHEME
A. Constructing the sensing matrix
The sensing matrix A is drawn from a random ensemble
denoted by M(n, m1 , L, `, ⇠, ). Here n, m1 , L, ` are integers
and ⇠, 2 (0, 1). The rows of A are partitioned as follows:
R=

[m1 Rk [ R0 ,
k=1

(5)

where |Rk | = L, and |R0 | = bn c. Hence, m = m1 L + bn c.
Notice that m/n = (m1 L + bn c)/n. Since we will take n
much larger than m1 L, the undersampling ratio m/n will be
arbitrary close to . Indeed, with an abuse of language, we
will refer to as the undersampling ratio.
We construct the sensing matrix A as follows:
1) For each k 2 {1, · · · , m1 }, and each r 2 Rk , ar = b2⇡k/n .
2) The rows {ar }r2R0 are deﬁned as

D. Contribution
Using spatial coupling and (approximate) message passing, the approaches of [8], [5] allow successful compressed
sensing recovery from a number of measurements achieving
the information-theoretic limit. While these can be formally
interpreted as sampling schemes for the discrete-time sampling problem introduced in Section I-A, they present in fact
several unrealistic features. In particular, the entries of A are
independent Gaussian entries with zero mean and suitably
chosen variances. It is obviously difﬁcult to implement such a
measurement matrix through a physical sampling mechanism.
The present paper aims at showing that the spatial coupling
phenomenon is –in the present context– signiﬁcantly more
robust and general than suggested by the constructions of
[8], [5]. Unfortunately, a rigorous analysis of message passing
algorithms is beyond reach for sensing matrices with dependent or deterministic entries. We thus introduce an ensemble
of sensing matrices, and show numerically that, under AMP
reconstruction, they allow recovery at undersampling rates
close to the information dimension. Similar simulations were
already presented by Krzakala et al. [8] in the case of matrices
with independent entries.
Our matrix ensemble can be thought of as a modiﬁcation of
the one in [4] for implementing spatial coupling. As mentioned
above, [4] suggests to sample the signal pointwise (instantaneously) in time. In the Fourier domain (in which the signal
is sparse) this corresponds to taking measurements that probe
all frequencies with the same weight. In other words, AF is
not band-diagonal as required in spatial coupling. Our solution
is to ‘smear out’ the samples: instead of measuring x(t⇤ ), we
modulate the signal with a wave of frequency !⇤ , and integrate
it over a window of size W 1 around t⇤ . In Fourier space, this
corresponds to integrating over frequencies within a window
W around !⇤ . Each measurement corresponds to a different
time-frequency pair (t⇤ , !⇤ ). While there are many possible
implementations of this idea, the Gabor transform offers an

ar (t) = a(t; tr , !r ) ,

where {tr }r2R0 are independent and uniformly random in Tn ,
and {!r }r2R0 are equispaced in ⌦n . Finally, for t⇤ 2 Tn , and

Here P⇠,` (t⇤ , t) is the probability that a random walk on the
circle with n sites {1, . . . , n} starting at time 0 at site t⇤ is
found at time ` at site t. The random walk is lazy, i.e. it stays
on the same position with probability 1 ⇠ 2 (0, 1) and moves
with probability ⇠ choosing either of the adjacent sites with
equal probability.
Notice that the probabilities P⇠,` (t⇤ , t) satisfy the recursion

Figure 1 shows the evolution of proﬁle (t) 2 Rm , given by

the spatial coupling phenomenon. In our sampling scheme,
additional measurements are associated to the ﬁrst few coordinates of x, namely, x1 , · · · , xm1 . This has negligible effect on

leads to a correct reconstruction of these entries (up to a mean

becomes of order 2 on the ﬁrst few entries after a few
iterations (see t = 5 in the ﬁgure). As the iteration proceeds,
the contribution of these components is correctly subtracted
from all the measurements, and essentially they are removed
from the problem. Now, in the resulting problem the ﬁrst
few variables are effectively oversampled and the algorithm

For each of them, we consider a set of sparsity parameters

the empirical phase transition through a logit ﬁt (we omit
details, but follow the methodology described in [6]).
1) Scheme I: We construct the sensing matrix as described
in Section II-A and for reconstruction, we use the algorithm
described in Section II-B. An illustration of the phase transition phenomenon is provided in Fig. 4. This corresponds to
" = 0.2 and an estimated phase transition location = 0.23.
As it is shown in Fig. 3, our results are consistent with the
hypothesis that this scheme achieves successful reconstruction

2) Scheme II: The sensing matrix AF is obtained by choosing m rows of the Fourier matrix F at random. In time domain,
this corresponds to sampling at m random time instants as in
[4]. Reconstruction is done via AMP algorithm with posterior
expectation as the denoiser ⌘. More speciﬁcally, through the
following iterative procedure.

Finally ↵⇤ = ↵⇤ (") is tuned to optimize the phase transition

For a given ", we denote by `1 (") the phase transition location
for `1 minimization, when sensing matrices with i.i.d. entries
are used. This coincides with the one of CAMP with optimally
tuned ↵ = ↵⇤ (") [18], [12].
The empirical phase transition of Scheme III is shown in
Fig. 3. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the
phase boundary coincides with `1 . In other words, spatiallycoupled sensing matrix does not improve the performances
under `1 reconstruction (or under AMP with soft-thresholding
denoiser). This agrees with earlier ﬁndings by Krzakala et al.
for Gaussian matrices ([8], and private communications). This
can be inferred from the the state evolution map. For AMP
with posterior expectation denoiser, and for " < < ˜("), the
state evolution map has two stable ﬁxed points; one of order
2
, and one much larger. Spatial coupling makes the algorithm
converge to the ‘right’ ﬁxed point. However, the state evolution
map corresponding to the soft-thresholding denoiser is concave
and has only one stable ﬁxed point, much larger than 2 .
Therefore, spatial coupling is not helpful in this setting.
