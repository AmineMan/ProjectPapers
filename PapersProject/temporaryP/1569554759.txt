CNOT gates.
The entanglement consumption rate vanishes for an arbitrary degradable channel with qubit input.
Following the multi-level coding method of Ref. [9], we
show how to extend the coding scheme to channels with multiple qubit inputs. This gives an explicit code construction for
the superactivation effect, in which two zero-capacity channels
have a non-zero quantum capacity when used together [10] (in
this sense, the channels activate each other).

Abstract—We construct a new entanglement-assisted quantum
polar coding scheme which achieves the symmetric coherent information rate by synthesizing “amplitude” and “phase” channels
from a given, arbitrary quantum channel. We ﬁrst demonstrate
the coding scheme for arbitrary quantum channels with qubit
inputs, and we show that quantum data can be reliably decoded
by O(N ) rounds of coherent quantum successive cancellation,
followed by N controlled-NOT gates (where N is the number of
channel uses). We also ﬁnd that the entanglement consumption
rate of the code vanishes for degradable quantum channels.
Finally, we extend the coding scheme to channels with multiple
qubit inputs. This gives a near-explicit method for realizing one
of the most striking phenomena in quantum information theory:
the superactivation effect, whereby two quantum channels which
individually have zero quantum capacity can have a non-zero
quantum capacity when used together.

A. Classical-quantum channels for complementary variables
Consider a quantum channel N with a two-dimensional
input system A and a d-dimensional output system B. Let
A
UN →BE denote the isometric extension of this channel.
Let |z denote the computational or “amplitude” basis with
z ∈ {0, 1}, and let |x denote the conjugate, Hadamard, or
√
“phase” basis with x ∈ {+, −} and |± ≡ (|0 ± |1 ) / 2.
Following Ref. [2], we consider building up a quantum
communication protocol from two classical communication
protocols that preserve classical information encoded into
complementary variables. In this vein, two particular classicalquantum (cq) channels are important. First, consider the cq
channel induced by sending an amplitude basis state over N :

Polar coding is a promising code construction for transmitting classical information over classical channels [1]. Arikan
proved that polar codes achieve the symmetric capacity of
any classical channel [1], with an encoding and decoding
complexity that is O (N log N ) where N is the number of
channel uses. These codes exploit the channel polarization
effect whereby a particular recursive encoding induces a set
of virtual channels, such that a fraction of the virtual channels
are perfect for data transmission while the other fraction are
useless for this task. The fraction containing perfect virtual
channels is equal to the channel’s symmetric capacity.
In this paper, we offer a new quantum polar coding scheme
strongly based on ideas of Renes and Boileau [2], who showed
that quantum coding protocols can be constructed from two
different protocols that protect classical information encoded
into complementary observables. In particular, a protocol for
reliably transmitting quantum data can be built from a protocol
that reliably recovers classical information encoded into an
“amplitude” observable and a protocol that reliably recovers
“phase” information with the assistance of quantum side
information (see Refs. [3], [4], [5], [6] for related ideas).
These ideas were used to construct a quantum polar coding
scheme with an efﬁcient decoder in [7], but only for a certain
set of channels with essentially classical outputs. Following
a different approach, Ref. [8] constructed quantum polar
codes for degradable channels. Our new quantum polar coding
scheme has several advantages over these previous schemes:
•

WA : z → N A →B (|z z|) ≡ φB ,
z

(1)

where the classical input z is a binary variable and the notation
WA indicates that the classical information is encoded into
the amplitude basis. We can regard this as the sender (Alice)
modulating a standard signal |0 with X z and transmitting the
result to the receiver (Bob).
For the other cq channel, suppose that Alice instead transmits a binary variable x by modulating the signal with Z x , a
rephasing of the amplitude basis states. However, instead of
applying this to |0 , she modulates one half of an entangled
qubit pair (ebit) shared with Bob. These qubits are in the state

The net rate of quantum communication is equal to the

is a puriﬁcation of φB in (1). The resulting cq

channel is then of the following form:
BC
WP : x → σx ,

and GN is Arikan’s encoding circuit matrix built from classical CNOT and permutation gates. The interpretation of this
channel is that it is the one “seen” by the input ui if all
of the previous bits ui−1 are available and if we consider
1
all the future bits uN as randomized. This motivates the
i+1
development of a quantum successive cancellation decoder
(QSCD) [11] that attempts to distinguish ui = 0 from ui = 1
by adaptively exploiting the results of previous measurements
and quantum hypothesis tests for each bit decision.
(i)
The synthesized channels WN polarize, in the sense that
some become nearly perfect for classical data transmission
while others become nearly useless. To prove this result, one
can model the channel splitting and combining process as
a random birth process [1], [11], and one can demonstrate
that the induced random birth processes corresponding to the
(i)
(i)
channel parameters I(WN ) and F (WN ) are martingales that
converge almost surely to zero-one valued random variables
in the limit of many recursions. The following theorem characterizes the rate with which the channel polarization effect
takes hold [11], and it is useful in proving statements about
the performance of polar codes for cq channels:
Theorem 1: Given a binary input cq channel W and any

(4)

where the notation WP indicates that the classical information
is encoded into a phase variable. In contrast to WA , the
channel WP is one in which the receiver has quantum side
information (in the form of system C) that is helpful for
decoding the transmitted phase information.1
Both cq channels in (1) and (4) arise in the error analysis
of our quantum polar coding scheme, in the sense that its
performance depends on the performance of constituent polar
codes constructed for these cq channels. Moreover, the two
channels are more closely related than they may initially
appear. To see their relationship, consider the state

Another important channel is the cq channel WE induced to
the environment when inputting amplitude-encoded classical

information: WE : z → TrB {UN →BE (|z z|)}. We do not
consider this channel for our quantum polar coding scheme
or its error analysis, but we instead consider it in Section II
when relating the quantum polar coding scheme of this paper
to the previous one from Ref. [8].
B. Channel Polarization
Two channel parameters that determine the performance
of a cq channel W : x → ρx are the ﬁdelity F (W ) ≡
√ √
2
ρ0 ρ1 1 and the symmetric Holevo information I (W ) ≡
H ((ρ0 + ρ1 ) /2) − [H (ρ0 ) + H (ρ1 )] /2 where H (σ) ≡
−Tr{σ log2 σ} is the von Neumann entropy. These parameters generalize the Bhattacharya parameter and the symmetric mutual information [1], respectively, and are related as
I (W ) ≈ 1 ⇔ F (W ) ≈ 0 and I (W ) ≈ 0 ⇔ F (W ) ≈ 1
[11]. The channel W is near perfect when I (W ) ≈ 1 and
near useless when I (W ) ≈ 0.
Ref. [11] demonstrated how to construct synthesized versions of W , by channel combining and splitting [1]. The
synthesized channels are of the following form:
(i)

(7)

and BN (W, β) ≡ [N ] \ GN (W, β), so that GN (W, β) is
the set of “good” channels and BN (W, β) is the set of
“bad” channels. The sender then transmits the information
bits through the good channels and “frozen” bits through the
bad ones. A helpful assumption for error analysis is that the
frozen bits are chosen uniformly at random such that the
sender and receiver both have access to these frozen bits.
Ref. [11] provided an explicit construction of a QSCD that has
β
(uAc )
an error probability equal to o(2−N )—let {ΛuA } denote
the corresponding decoding POVM, with uA the information
bits and uAc the frozen bits.
For our quantum polar coding scheme, we exploit a coherent
version of Arikan’s encoder [1], meaning that the gates are
quantum CNOTs and permutations (this is the same encoder
as in Refs. [7], [8]). When sending amplitude-basis classical
information through the encoder and channels, the effect is
(i)
to induce synthesized channels WA,N as described above.
Theorem 1 states that the fraction of amplitude-good channels
(according to the criterion in (7)) is equal to I (Z; B)φ where
the Holevo information I (Z; B)φ is evaluated with respect
Z
1
to the cq state φZB = 2 z∈{0,1} |z z| ⊗ φB , with φz
z
deﬁned in (1). It will be convenient to express this quantity as

I (W ), where n indicates the level of recursion for the
(I)
encoding, W2n is a random variable characterizing the I th
(I)
split channel, and F (W2n ) is the ﬁdelity of that channel.
Assuming knowledge of the good and bad channels, one can
then construct a coding scheme based on the channel polarization effect, by dividing the synthesized channels according
to the following polar coding rule:

operationally to a Bell state shared before communication begins.

system A is ﬁrst measured in the amplitude basis.
As in [7], the same encoding operation leads to channel
polarization for the phase channel WP as well. Suppose Alice
modulates her halves of the entangled pairs as before, but then
inputs them to the coherent encoder before sending them via
the channel to Bob. The result is

Z ≡ BN (WA , β) ∩ GN (WP , β) ,

Our quantum polar coding scheme has the sender transmit
information qubits through the inputs in A, frozen bits in
the phase basis through the inputs in X , frozen bits in the
amplitude basis through the inputs in Z, and halves of ebits
[12] through the inputs in B (we can think of these in some
sense as being frozen simultaneously in both the amplitude and
phase basis). It is straightforward to prove (see Appendix A
of Ref. [13]) that the net rate [12] of quantum communication (|A| − |B|) /N is equal to the coherent information
I (A B) ≡ H (B) − H (AB) by observing that the fraction of
amplitude-good channels is I Z A ; B ψ , the fraction of phasegood channels is I X A ; BC ψ , and exploiting the relation
I X A ; BC ψ = 1 − I Z A ; E ψ .

whose B N C N marginal state is simply UE σxN GT UE ,

where UE denotes the polar encoder. Here we have used
the fact that the matrix corresponding to GN is invertible.
Thus, the coherent encoder also induces synthesized channels
(i)
WP,N using the encoding matrix GT instead of GN , modulo
N
the additional UE acting on C N . Note that the classical
(i)
side information for the WP,N is different from that in (5)
because the direction of all CNOT gates is ﬂipped due to
the transpose of GN when acting on phase variables. The
change in the direction of the CNOT gates means that the
(i)
ith synthesized phase channel WP,N is such that all of the
future bits xN · · · xi+1 are available to help in decoding bit
xi while all of the previous bits xi−1 · · · x1 are randomized.
(This is the same as described in Ref. [7] for Pauli channels.)
For the channel in (4), the fraction of phase-good channels
is approximately equal to I (X; BC)σ , where the Holevo
information I (X; BC)σ is with respect to a cq state of the
X
BC
BC
form 1 x∈{0,1} |x x| ⊗ σx , with σx in (4). Again, we
2
can formulate this using |ψ as I(X A ; BC)ψ , this time X A
indicating A is measured in the phase basis.
Lemma 2 of Ref. [2] outlines an important relationship between the Holevo information of the phase channel to Bob and
the Holevo information of the amplitude channel to Eve, which
for our case reduces to I X A ; BC ψ = 1 − I Z A ; E ψ .
This relationship already suggests that channels which are
phase-good for Bob should be amplitude-bad for Eve and that
channels which are amplitude-good for Eve should be phasebad for Bob, allowing us in Section II to relate the present
quantum polar coding scheme to that from Ref. [8].

D. Error Analysis
We now demonstrate that this coding scheme works well.
The sender and receiver begin with the following state:
|Ψ0 = N0

|uA |uA |uZ |uX |uB ⊗ |uB ,
uA ,uB

where Alice possesses the ﬁrst ﬁve registers, Bob the last one,2
√
and N0 ≡ 1/ 2|A|+|B| . We also assume for now that the bits
in uZ and uX are chosen uniformly at random and are known
to both the sender and receiver. Note that the 4th register is
expressed in the phase basis; the amplitude basis instead gives
|Ψ0 = N1

(−1)

uX ·vX

|uA |uA |uZ |vX |uB ⊗ |uB ,

uA ,uB ,vX

√
where N1 ≡ 1/ 2|A|+|B|+|X | . The sender then feeds the
middle four registers through the polar encoder and channel,
leading to a state of the following form:
|Ψ1 = N1

(−1)

uX ·vX

|uA ⊗ |φuA ,uZ ,vX ,uB

|uB ,

uA ,uB ,vX

⊗N
where |φuA ,uZ ,vX ,uB
≡ UN UE |uA |uZ |vX |uB
(abusing notation, the encoding operation GN is left implicit).
Observe that, conditioned on amplitude measurements of
|uA and |uB , the B N subsystem is identical to the polarencoded output of WA . Thus, the ﬁrst step of the decoder is
the following coherent implementation of the QSCD for WA
as in (1):

C. Coding scheme
(i)

We divide the synthesized cq amplitude channels WA,N
into sets GN (WA , β) and BN (WA , β) according to (7), and
(i)
similarly, we divide the synthesized cq phase channels WP,N
into sets GN (WP , β) and BN (WP , β), where β < 1/2. The
synthesized channels correspond to particular inputs to the
encoding operation, and thus the set of all inputs divides into
four groups: those that are good for both the amplitude and
phase variable, those that are good for amplitude and bad for
phase, bad for amplitude and good for phase, and those that
are bad for both variables. We establish notation for these
channels as follows:

(u ,u )

B
Z
ΛuA ,vX ⊗|uA |vX ⊗|uB |uB

uB |⊗|uZ . (9)

uA ,uB ,vX

The idea here is that the decoder is coherently recovering the
bits in uA and vX while using those in uZ and uB as classical
and quantum side information, respectively. After doing so, the

A ≡ GN (WA , β) ∩ GN (WP , β) ,

2 In quantum information theory the tensor product symbol is often used
implicitly. Our convention is to leave it implicit for systems belonging to the
same party and use it explicitly to denote a division between two parties.

Rewriting phase terms with Pauli operators, we then have that

the actual output of this step of the decoder is o(2−N )-close
in expected trace distance to the following ideal state:

where N4 ≡ 1/ 2|A|+|B|+|Z| . Here Z xA ,xZ ,uX ,xB is shorthand for Z xA ⊗ Z xZ ⊗ Z uX ⊗ Z xB , which acts on the second
qubits in the entangled pairs, while the encoding and channel
unitaries act on the ﬁrst.
The ﬁnal step in the decoding process is to remove the
phase operator Z xA ,xZ ,vX ,xB by controlled operations from
the registers |xA |xZ |uX |xB to the second qubits in the
entangled pairs. This phase-basis controlled phase operation
is equivalent to N CNOT operations from the latter systems
to the former and results in

The expectation is with respect to the uniformly random choice
of uX . Thus, Bob has coherently recovered the bits uA and
vX with the decoder in (9), while making a second coherent
and incoherent copy of the bits uB and uZ , respectively.
The next step in the process is to make coherent use of the
WP decoder. For this to be useful, however, we must show
BCE
that encoded versions of |σx
, as in (8), are present in
|Ψ2 . To see this, ﬁrst observe that we can write
|Ψ2 = N2

(−1)

uX ·vX +xA ·uA +xB ·uB

|φuA ,uZ ,vX ,uB
|uA |vX |uB |xB |uZ ,
√
where N2 ≡ 1/ 22|A|+2|B|+|X | , by expressing the ﬁrst
register and the second |uB register in the phase basis. This
is nearly the expression we are looking for, as all the desired
phase factors are present, except one corresponding to |uZ .
As uZ is chosen at random, we can describe it quantummechanically as arising from part of an entangled state. The
other part is shared by Alice and an inaccessible reference.
Including this puriﬁcation degree of freedom, |Ψ2 becomes
|Ψ2 = N3

(−1)

uX ·vX +xA ·uA +xB ·uB

|xA ⊗

|uA |vX |uB |xB |uZ ⊗ |uZ ,
√
where N3 = N2 / 2|Z| . Again utilizing the phase basis gives
uX ·vX +xA ·uA +xB ·uB +xZ ·uZ

(−1)

|xA ⊗

uA ,uB ,vX ,uZ ,
xA ,xB ,xZ

|φuA ,uZ ,vX ,uB

BN EN

|uA |vX |uB |xB |uZ ⊗ |xZ .

Thus, |Ψ2 is a superposition of polar encoded states as in (8)
and therefore the phase decoder will be useful to the receiver.

In particular, Bob can ﬁrst apply UE

with Bob sharing 1/ 2|Z| xZ |xZ ⊗ |xZ with the inaccessible reference. Thus the sender and receiver generate |A|

Remark 2: The above scheme performs well with respect
to a uniformly random choice of the bits uX and uZ , in the
sense that the expectation of the ﬁdelity is high. Though, we
can invoke Markov’s inequality to demonstrate that a large
fraction of the possible codes have good performance.
Remark 3: The ﬁrst step of the decoder is identical to
the ﬁrst step of the decoder from Ref. [8]. Though, the
second step above is an improvement over the second step
in Ref. [8] because it is an explicit coherent QSCD, rather
than an inexplicit controlled-decoupling unitary. Additionally,
the decoder’s complexity is equivalent to O (N ) quantum
hypothesis tests and other unitaries resulting from the polar

decompositions of ΛuA ,vX and ΓxA ,xZ , but it remains
unclear how to implement these efﬁciently.

II. Z ERO E - BIT RATE FOR DEGRADABLE CHANNELS
We can now prove that the entanglement consumption rate
of our quantum polar coding scheme vanishes for an arbitrary
degradable quantum channel. We provide a brief summary
of the proof (see Appendix C of Ref. [13] for more detail).
Consider the following entropic uncertainty principle [3]:
H(X A |B)ρ +H(Z A |E)ρ ≥ 1, where the conditional entropies
are with respect to the phase and amplitude observables
X and Z measured with respect to a tripartite state ρABE
with A being a qubit system. Using this and the fact that
H(X A )+H(Z A ) = 2 for our case, we can prove the following
(i)
uncertainty relation for the ith synthesized channels WP,N and
(i)
(i)
(i)
WE,N : I(WP,N ) + I(WE,N ) ≤ 1, which is reminiscent of
the relation I (X; BC) = 1 − I (Z; E) mentioned previously.
The above uncertainty relation then implies the following one:

xB |

xA ,xZ ,xB

to coherently extract the values of xA and xZ using the
CN
frozen bits xB and uX . He then applies UE to restore the
C N registers to their previous form. As with the amplitude
decoding step, the closeness of the output of this process to
the ideal output is governed by the error probability of the
WP decoder (see Appendix B of Ref. [13]). To express the
ideal output succinctly, we ﬁrst make the assignments

F (WE,N ) ≥ 1. This in turn implies that

the phase-good channels to Bob are amplitude-“very bad”
channels to Eve. From degradability, we also know that the
doubly-bad channels in B are amplitude-bad channels to Eve.
These two observations imply that the phase-good channels
to Bob, the doubly-bad channels to Bob, and amplitude-good
channels to Eve are disjoint sets. Furthermore, we know from
Theorem 1 that the sum rate of the phase-good channels
to Bob and the amplitude-good channels to Eve is equal to
I (X; BC) + I (Z; E) = 1 − I (Z; E) + I (Z; E) = 1 as
N → ∞, implying that the rate of the doubly-bad channel set
B (the entanglement consumption rate) approaches zero in the
same limit. This same argument implies that the entanglement
consumption rate for the quantum polar codes in Ref. [8]
vanishes for degradable quantum channels because the rate
of the phase-good channels to Bob is a lower bound on the
rate of the amplitude-“very bad” channels to Eve.

variables as QSI.) For the second qubit space in the tensor factor, the net quantum data rate is I (Z2 ; BZ1 ) +
I (X2 ; BZ1 Z2 Z3 Z4 X1 ) − 1. We can similarly determine the
respective net quantum data rates for the third and fourth qubit
spaces as I (Z3 ; BZ1 Z2 ) + I (X3 ; BZ1 Z2 Z3 Z4 X1 X2 ) − 1,
I (Z4 ; BZ1 Z2 Z3 ) + I (X4 ; BZ1 Z2 Z3 Z4 X1 X2 X3 ) − 1. Summing all these rates together with the chain rule and using the
fact that any two amplitude and/or phase variables are independent whenever i = j, we obtain the overall net quantum data
rate: I (Z1 Z2 Z3 Z4 ; B) + I (X1 X2 X3 X4 ; BZ1 Z2 Z3 Z4 ) − 4,
which is equal to the coherent information of the joint channel
(by applying the same Lemma 2 of Ref. [2]). The fact that
our quantum polar code can achieve the symmetric coherent
information rate then proves that superactivation occurs, given
that Smith and Yard already showed that this rate is non-zero
for the channels mentioned above [10].

III. S UPERACTIVATION
Our quantum polar coding scheme can be adapted to realize
the superactivation effect, in which two zero-capacity quantum
channels can activate each other when used jointly, such that
the joint channel has a non-zero quantum capacity [10]. Recall
that the channels from Ref. [10] are a four-dimensional PPT
channel and a four-dimensional 50% erasure channel. Each of
these have zero quantum capacity, but the joint tensor-product
channel has non-zero capacity.3
We now discuss how to realize a quantum polar coding
scheme for the joint channel. Observe that the input space
of the joint channel is 16-dimensional and thus has a decomposition as a tensor product of four qubit-input spaces:
C4 ⊗ C4 C16 C2 ⊗ C2 ⊗ C2 ⊗ C2 . Thus, we can exploit a
slightly modiﬁed version of our qubit polar coding scheme.
Following [9], the idea is for Alice and Bob to employ a
quantum polar code for each qubit in the tensor factor. Let
Z1 , . . . , Z4 denote the amplitude variables of these qubits and
let X1 , . . . , X4 denote the phase variables. Bob’s decoder is
such that he coherently decodes Z1 , uses it as quantum side
information (QSI) to decode Z2 , uses both Z1 and Z2 as QSI
to decode Z3 , and then uses all of Z1 , . . . , Z3 to help decode
Z4 . With all of the amplitude variables decoded, Bob then uses
these as QSI to decode X1 , and continues successively until
he coherently decodes X4 . At the end he performs controlled
phase gates to recover entanglement established with Alice.
We now calculate the total rate of this scheme. For the
ﬁrst qubit space in the tensor factor, the channels split up
into four types depending on whether they are good/bad
for amplitude/phase. Using the formula (10) in Appendix A
of Ref. [13], the net quantum data rate for the ﬁrst tensor factor is equal to I (Z1 ; B) + I (X1 ; BZ1 Z2 Z3 Z4 ) − 1.
(The formula is slightly different here because Bob decodes the phase variable X1 with all of the amplitude

IV. C ONCLUSION
Our quantum polar coding scheme has two beneﬁts over the
work in Refs. [8], [7]: it achieves the symmetric coherent information rate for an arbitrary quantum channel and its entanglement consumption rate vanishes for an arbitrary degradable
channel. Though, we should clarify that the analysis here actually implies that the scheme from Ref. [8] has the above two
properties. A further beneﬁt over the scheme from Ref. [8] is
that the decoder here is explicitly realized as O (N ) rounds of
coherent quantum successive cancellation, followed by O (N )
controlled-phase gates. Finally, we outlined how the scheme
here can exhibit the superactivation effect. We acknowledge
discussions with F. Dupuis, S. Guha, and G. Smith.

3 We are speaking of catalytic superactivation. A catalytic protocol uses
entanglement assistance, but the ﬁgure of merit is the net rate of quantum
communication—the total quantum communication rate minus the entanglement consumption rate. Note that the catalytic quantum capacity is equal to
zero if the standard quantum capacity is zero. Thus, the superactivation effect
that we speak of in this section is for the catalytic quantum capacity.
