Exact Scalar Minimum Storage
Coordinated Regenerating Codes
Nicolas Le Scouarnec
Technicolor
Rennes, France
on coordinated regenerating codes [2] with exact repair. We
consider the case of n, k, d > k, t > 1 for scalar constructions
(i.e., β = 1) and make the following contributions:
• In the line of exact scalar minimum storage regenerating codes [5], [8], [9], we propose exact scalar minimum storage coordinated regenerating codes (MSCR) for
n, k = 2, d ≥ k, t = n − d. This interference alignment
based construction is inspired by [5], [9]. (Section III)
• Scalar MSR codes can be repaired exactly by aligning
interferences independently [5], [7]. We show that when
k ≥ 3, aligning interferences independently is not sufﬁcient to repair exactly scalar MSCR codes. (Section IV).
Note that these results, which correspond to the MSCR point,
also apply to exact scalar adaptive regenerating codes [2].
Most previous works have been limited to single failures
(t = 1). For multiple failures, there only exist results for
the case n, k, d = k, t = n − k, a degenerated case where
the repair of regenerating codes boils down to repairing, in
parallel, t independent erasure correcting codes [4]. A similar
construction exists for MBCR codes [10].
The extended version of the article [11] can be referred to
for more details on the codes constructions and the related
work.

Abstract—We study the exact and optimal repair of multiple
failures in codes for distributed storage. More particularly, we
examine the use of interference alignment to build exact scalar
minimum storage coordinated regenerating codes (MSCR). We
show that it is possible to build codes for the case of k = 2
and d ≥ k by aligning interferences independently but that this
technique cannot be applied as soon as k ≥ 3 and d > k. Our
results also apply to adaptive regenerating codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Codes allow distributed storage systems to tolerate failures
of some devices. Yet, repairing naively by downloading and
decoding the whole code induces high repair costs. Regenerating codes reduce this cost by repairing without decoding.
Optimal tradeoffs between storage and repair cost (network
bandwidth) have been established both for the single failure
case [1] and for the multiple failures case [2]–[4] using network information theory. Adaptive regenerating codes, which
allow the number of devices involved to differ between repairs,
have been deﬁned in [2]. The two extreme points of the
optimal tradeoffs are Minimum Bandwidth (MBR/MBCR),
which minimizes repair cost ﬁrst, and Minimum Storage
(MSR/MSCR), which minimizes storage ﬁrst as shown on
Figure 1c. Codes matching these theoretical tradeoffs can be
built using non-deterministic random linear network codes.
In this case, repairs are termed as functional repair (Figure 1a) for the regenerated data is not strictly equal to the
lost data. However, such non-deterministic schemes are not
desirable for they (i) require homomorphic hash functions
to provide basic security (integrity checking), (ii) cannot be
turned into systematic codes, which offer access to data
without decoding, and (iii) they can only provide probabilistic
guarantees. Deterministic schemes overcome these issues by
offering exact repair (i.e., during a repair, the regenerated block
is equal to the lost block and not only equivalent as shown on
Figure 1b). Yet, it has been shown that exact repair is strictly
harder than functional repair [5], [6] , which means that the
existence of functional regenerating codes does not imply that
exact regenerating codes exist. Hence, an interesting question
is whether the previous tradeoffs, which apply to functional
repairs, can still be achieved for exact repairs. The problem of
repairing exactly a single failure has been well studied [5]–[9].
However, the exact repair of multiple failures remains an open
question since it has been studied only for the very speciﬁc
setting d = k [4], [10].
We focus on this problem, and extend our previous work

II. M ODEL
We consider a system storing a ﬁle of M bits spread onto
n devices (each storing α = M bits) such that the ﬁle can be
k
recovered by collecting enough data from any k devices. For
repairing coordinated regenerating codes, each failed device1
contacts d ≥ k live devices and gets β bits from each. The
t failed devices coordinate by exchanging β bits. The data
is then processed and α bits are stored. These studies lead
to the deﬁnition of the optimal tradeoffs between storage α
and repair costs γ = dβ + (t − 1)β . The values of α, β and
β corresponding to MSCR and MBCR codes are recalled on
Figure 1c. In this paper, we will focus on MSCR constructions
for they are very close to classical erasure correcting codes and
are highly related to adaptive regenerating codes.
In the sequel of the article, we will study the exact repair of
regenerating codes when multiple failures occur. We study the
non-degenerated case of d > k and use scalar codes (β = 1).
1 In the article, we use failed devices to designate either the devices that
have failed, or the new spare devices that hold the repaired data. The meaning
will be clear from the context.

(c) Tradeoff curve

Figure 1. Regenerating codes offer the optimal tradeoffs (c) between storage and repair bandwidth (network). Regenerating codes can be repaired functionally
or exactly. In our example, the device storing (a1 , a2 ) fails and is regenerated. When relying on functional repairs (a), the information about (a1 , a2 ) is
regenerated but not in the same form, while when relying on exact repairs (b), (a1 , a2 ) is repaired exactly.

We adopt the following conventions: data v and codewords w
are column vectors, the generator matrix G is rectangular and
the encoding operation w = Gv gives a column vector.

B. Repairing two failures
The repair consists of the following steps, which map
onto the process deﬁned in [2]. In this scheme, illustrated in
Figure 2, we do not rely on random linear network coding but
give a method for repairing exactly.
1. Identify lost data. Given the failure of any two devices
(systematic or redundancy), we perform a change of variables
to transform the actual code C into a code C , in which the
failed devices are the systematic ones storing a = (a1 . . . ad )t
and b = (b1 . . . bd )t . Such a code is guaranteed to exist since
the original code is MDS (same argument as in [5]).
2. Prepare (Collect). Each live device that participates to
the repair computes a sub-block to be sent to the ﬁrst device
and a sub-block to be sent to the second device. All the subblocks to be sent to the ﬁrst device have the common property
that the interfering information about b is aligned (i.e., the
i-th live device, storing ri , use vα i as a repair vector and
sends3 vαi ri = wαi a + zα b so that the spare device receives
different information about a but the same about b. To build
vαi , given some arbitrary alignment vector zα and given that
ri = Ai a + Bi b, the repair vector is vαi = zα B−1 . Since
i
the MDS property is satisﬁed (i.e., we can recover from a
and ri ), Bi is invertible, and the repair vector exists. The
role of a and b are reversed for sub-blocks to be sent to the
second device.

III. E XACT MSCR CODES FOR k = 2
We consider a system storing a ﬁle of size M = k(d−k+t)
split in k = 2 blocks (a, b), each of size α = d − k + t
sub-blocks. The system consists of n = d + t devices as we
assume that all failed devices and all live devices take part to
the repair2 . In the sequel of the article, we consider a ﬁnite
ﬁeld Fq of size q and having a generator element ω.
The system is compounded of two devices storing the
systematic part and s = n − 2 devices storing the redundancy
part.
t
• The ﬁrst systematic device stores a = (a1 , . . . , aα ) .
t
• The second systematic device stores b = (b1 , . . . , bα ) .
• The i-th redundancy device, i ∈ {0 . . . α − 1}, stores
ri = (a1 + ω i mod α b1 , . . . , aα + ω i+α−1 mod α bα )t
An example for k = 2, d = 3 and t = 2 is given on Figure 3.
Using the previously deﬁned code, we can state the two
following theorems:
Theorem 1. Minimum storage coordinated regenerating codes
can be repaired exactly (for the systematic devices) when n =
d + t, k = 2 and t = 2 (i.e., multiple repairs are performed
simultaneously). Similarly, adaptive regenerating codes with
k = 2 can be repaired exactly.

3 In this description, v r , w a or z b are of scalars (i.e., the resulting
αi i
αi
αi
matrices are of dimension 1 × 1). As a result ca = (vα1 r1 , . . . , vαd rd )t is
t a matrix of dimension (d + 1) × 1.
a matrix of size d × 1 and (ca |cb vα0 )

Proof: In the sequel of this section, we show that (i) the
code we deﬁne is an MDS code (i.e., the original data can be
recovered from any k = 2 devices) and (ii) the two systematic
devices can be repaired exactly. To repair exactly adaptive
regenerating codes, we require that any single failure can be
repaired, in addition to the two aforementioned properties.

A. The MDS property
This property is trivially satisﬁed since, when fetching data
from any two devices, we get α groups of 2 equations over
2 unknowns, where each group concerns different unknowns.
The ith group is about ai and bi and consist of 2 independent equations. Hence, the unknowns of each group can be
recovered and the MDS property is satisﬁed.

Figure 3. Exact repair of the systematic part of an MSCR code (n = 5, k = 2, d = 3, t = 2). The state of the system after the storing step is not shown
but it is clear that the ﬁrst device can recover a and that the second one can recover b.

3. Transfer (Collect). The sub-blocks are sent and the
ﬁrst (resp. second) device stores them temporarily as ca =
(vα1 r1 , . . . , vαd rd )t (resp. cb ) for use in steps 4 and 6.
4. Prepare (Coordinate). Using what has been received
in step 3, the second spare device prepares a sub-block
vα0 cb = wα0 a + zα b to be sent to the ﬁrst spare device.
The information about b is aligned as in sub-blocks prepared
during step 2. Again, the role a and b are reversed for the
sub-block to be sent from the ﬁrst to the second spare device.
5. Transfer (Coordinate). The sub-blocks are sent and the
ﬁrst (resp. second) spare devices adds them to blocks received
in step 3 thus storing (ca |vα0 cb )t (resp. (cb |vβ0 ca )t ).
6. Recover and Store. The d + 1 sub-blocks (ca |vα0 cb )t =
(wα1 a + zα b, . . . , wαd a + zα b, wα0 a + zα b)t allow recovering both the interfering information zα b (but not the
individual values of bi ), and the desired information a =
(a1 . . . ad )t . Indeed, the received sub-blocks deﬁne d + 1
equations over d+1 unknowns (zα b, a1 , . . . , ad ). The second
spare device performs a similar processing with the role of
a and b reversed.

As a consequence, it consists of a system of α + 1 independent equations and α + 1 unknowns (ai s and σb). As a result,
the α unknowns ai can be recovered. The second device has
received something similar with the roles a and b exchanged.
This repair method applied to a code (n = d + t, k = 2, d >
k, t = 2) (n = 5 and d = 3 on Figure 3) naturally extends to
other cases such as codes n > d + t, k = 2, d > k, t = 2.
C. Repairing one device
Finally, repairing one single device is easier, and interference alignment has already been used [5], [9]. However, we
need to show that the code construction we present, which
supports t = 2, also supports t = 1 to get exact scalar adaptive
regenerating codes. We can apply the same repair method as
for repairing two devices except that there is no coordination
step and the other systematic device sends directly zα b = σb
during the collecting step. As a result, after the collection
step, the failed device has received α + 1 equations. Since
the information about b is aligned, it can be written as

We now apply this general method to the repair of the
systematic part of the code we deﬁne, as shown on Figure 3.
A ﬁnite ﬁeld of size q = n − 1 is sufﬁcient to offer the repair
of the systematic devices using the previously deﬁned code.
In order to repair the two systematic devices on the code
we deﬁned, during the collecting step the i-th redundancy
device sends (ω −(i mod α) , . . . , ω −(i+α−1 mod α) )ri to the
ﬁrst device being repaired and (1 . . . 1)ri to the second device
being repaired. The vectors vαi (resp. vβi ) are chosen so that
zα = σ (resp. zβ = σ) with σ = (1 . . . 1) (α terms). We note
ca (respectively cb ) the vector of d symbols received by the
device repairing a (respectively b).

As a consequence, it consists of a system of α + 1 independent equations and α + 1 unknowns (ai s and σb). As a
result, the α unknowns ai can be recovered.
Since the code we present has the MDS property and
supports both repairs of single failures (t = 1) and repairs of
two failures (t = 2), it implies that it is possible to design exact
scalar MSCR codes and exact scalar adaptive regenerating
codes when k = 2, thus leading to Theorem 1.

At the coordination step, the ﬁrst systematic device sends
(ω −0 + · · · + ω −(α−1) )−1 σca to the second one, while the
second one sends (ω 0 + · · · + ω α−1 )−1 σcb to the ﬁrst one.
At the end of these steps, the ﬁrst device has received α + 1
equations. Let us note µ = 1 + · · · + 1 (α terms). Since the
interfering information about bi is aligned, it writes as

IV. I MPOSSIBILITY OF I NDEPENDENT I NTERFERENCE
A LIGNMENT FOR E XACT MSCR WHEN k ≥ 3

We are going to prove, by contradiction, that exact repair
of systematic codes in the scalar case (i.e., β = 1) is not
achievable when k ≥ 3 and t ≥ 2. For the sake of clarity, our
proof will describe the case of t = 2, k = 3 and d = 4 but it
naturally extends to any larger value.
Assume that it is possible to repair exactly. Hence, it is
possible to repair the simultaneous failure of devices storing
a and b. We consider this case and examine how exact repair
constraints the system.
For each device being repaired, all live devices project what
they store onto a single vector and send this vector to the
said device being repaired. Then, the devices being repaired
coordinate by exchanging a single vector (a projection of
what they have received so far). Hence, the device repairing
a receives, at the end of both the collecting step and the
coordination step:

In this section, we examine whether the previous scheme,
inspired by the repair of single failures [5], [9], can be applied
to multiple failures when k ≥ 3. This overall section is related
to [5], [7] and similarly shows that requiring exact repairs overconstrains the system and requires alignment of information
that cannot be aligned to maintain the MDS property thus
leading to a contradiction.
When repairing a single failed systematic4 block a, the
information about the k − 1 other systematic blocks must
be aligned as shown in [5]. In particular, it is required that
blocks are aligned independently. Indeed, if we consider that
the systematic devices send vectors vβ b, vγ c. . . , and that
the i-th redundancy device sends vαi a + vβi b + vγi c . . . , to
the device repairing a, then colspan (vβi ) = colspan (vβ ),
colspan (vγi ) = colspan (vγ ). . . for all i (i.e., systematic
blocks are considered independently and all the information
about each interfering block received at the device performing
the repair spans only one dimension).
We show that under this requirement, exact repair is not
possible if k ≥ 3. We give a proof, and explain the meaning
of this impossibility on the information ﬂow graph.

To be able to recover a, we must be able to decode the
d − k + t = 3 desired unknowns of a out of the d + t − 1 = 5
equations containing a total of k(d − k + t) = 9 unknowns.
The same applies for b. Hence, when aligning independently
we must have,

Theorem 2. When requiring interference alignment to be
applied independently for each interfering systematic device,
it is not possible to repair exactly MSCR codes with k ≥ 3,
t ≥ 2 , d > k in the scalar case (i.e., M = k(d − k + t) such
that each device stores only d−k+t sub-blocks of size β = 1).
This impossibility also applies to adaptive regenerating codes.

Proof: Since any MDS code C can be turned into a
systematic code C (as explained in [5]), we base our proof on
Lemma 3. Indeed, if it was possible to repair exactly MSCR
codes with k ≥ 3 and t ≥ 2, it would be possible to build
exact systematic MSCR codes. Moreover, if it was possible to
exactly repair adaptive regenerating codes, it would be possible
to derive MSCR codes by using the same repair method and
restricting it to t = 2. Hence, the impossibility result extends
to adaptive regenerating codes.

Let us consider the choice of vectors vγ , vαi , vβi and of
matrices Ci that allows exact repairs (i.e., such that constraints
on ranks are satisﬁed) with coordination (i.e., k ≥ 3 and t ≥
2):
• All vαi Ci must be collinear according to (2).
• All vβi Ci must be collinear too according to (3).
• During the coordination step, what is sent by the device
repairing a will necessarily be collinear to vαi Ci (i.e.,
what is stored) and to vector vγ . Let us name this vector,
which is colinear to vγ , zc . According to (3), zc , and
hence vγ must be colinear to all vβi Ci . Hence, we have:
∀i, vαi = νi vγ C−1 and vβi = µi vγ C−1 . Note that the
i
i
matrix Ci is invertible to guarantee the MDS property.
As a result, for all i ∈ {1 . . . d}, vectors vαi and vβi are

Lemma 3. When requiring interference alignment to be applied independently on all devices, it is not possible to repair
exactly systematic MSCR codes with k ≥ 3, t ≥ 2 , d > k in
the scalar case (i.e., β = 1).
Proof: Let us consider a code with k ≥ 3, t ≥ 2, d > k,
n ≥ d + t and α = d − k + t. Let us assume that we want
independent interference alignment (i.e., each interfering block
spans only a sub-space of dimension 1).
The k ﬁrst devices store systematic blocks as vectors
a = (ai )1≤i≤α , b = (bi )1≤i≤α , c = (ci )1≤i≤α . . . The
n − k remaining devices store redundancy blocks as rj =
A1 a + B1 b + C1 c + . . . . Thus leading to a set-up similar to
the one depicted on Figure 4.

Let us consider the choice of matrices for Bi that allows
exact repairs on the device repairing a. According to (2), we

4 Again, the repair of a redundancy block in a code C is equivalent to the
repair of a systematic block in a code C .

Impossibility of achieving exact repair of the systematic part of an MSCR code (k ≥ 3, d > k and t ≥ 2).

must have rank (B1 vα1 , . . . , Bd vαd ) = 1, which is equivalent
to:
ρ1 vα1 B1 = ρ2 vα2 B2 = · · · = ρd vαd Bd

As a result, rank (B1 vβ1 , . . . , Bd vβd ) = 1, which is
in contradiction with (3) (i.e., b can be repaired too, or
rank (B1 vβ1 , . . . , Bd vβd ) ≥ d − 1). Hence, the exact repair
of two failed devices when k ≥ 3 is impossible.
The proof naturally extends to any higher value of k and t.
Hence, repairing exactly scalar (i.e., β = 1) codes with d > k,
k > 2, and t > 1 is impossible when relying on independent
interference alignment.
This impossibility means that at some point, the amount of
information that goes through the information ﬂow graph [1],
[2] is too low. Indeed, to ensure that the ﬁle is kept over time,
all cuts between the source S and any data collector DC in a
graph representing the transfer of data between devices during
repairs must be greater than or equal to M [2]. However, if we
consider the graph of Figure 5 and force the device storing c to
send the same β bits of information (by requiring alignment)
to both the device storing a and the device storing b, then
the cut shown on the graph of Figure 5 has an insufﬁcient
capacity.

Figure 5. If the system is constrained so that the third (or any additional)
interfering device sends the same information to all devices because of
alignment constraints, the ﬂow that can go through the network is no longer
equal to the ﬁle size M. In this example, where M = 9β and α = 3β, the
capacity of the cut shown is only α + 5β = 8β < M.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we applied independent interference alignment
to minimum storage coordinated regenerating codes (MSCR)
and show that this technique allows exact repair if and only if
k = 2. Our results also apply to adaptive regenerating codes
thus providing an interesting solution for the implementation
of practical systems when k = 2.
To overcome the impossibility shown in this paper, several
tracks can be considered: (i) considering a technique that does
not align the interferences independently, (ii) building vector
codes (i.e., relying on sub-packetization with β > 1 by opposition to scalar codes β = 1 considered in this paper), or (iii)
building minimum bandwidth coordinated regenerating codes
(MBCR) (for single failure, codes exist for all parameters [8]).
