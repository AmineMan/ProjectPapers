Speciﬁcally, we show that for a symmetric convex polytope deﬁned by m hyperplanes, the truncated series estimator is within
O(log m) factor of the optimal. Previously, such results have
only been obtained for particular family of convex polytopes
such as those corresponding to the Lipschitz condition [13] or
satisfying certain isometric conditions [17]. As a motivating
example, we discuss one application of our result in estimating
values of a Lipschitz function.
Example. One important estimation problem in the literature
is the estimation of functions satisfying certain continuity or
Lipschitz conditions from noisy measurements. Consider a
univariate Lipschitz function f : [0, 1] → R. Suppose that
xi = f (ti ) for i = 1, . . . , n, and we have measurements yi
according to the model yi = xi + wi for some gaussian noise
wi . Then Lipschitz condition, with constant L, translates to
the linear constraints:

Abstract—We study the optimality of the minimax risk of
truncated series estimators over symmetric convex polytopes.
We show that the optimal truncated series estimator is within
O(log m) factor of the optimal if the polytope is deﬁned by
m hyperplanes. This represents the ﬁrst such bounds towards
general convex bodies. In proving our result, we ﬁrst deﬁne a
geometric quantity, called the approximation radius, for lower
bounding the minimax risk. We then derive our bounds by establishing a connection between the approximation radius and the
Kolmogorov width, the quantity that provides upper bounds for
the truncated series estimator. Besides, our proof contains several
ingredients which might be of independent interest: 1. The notion
of approximation radius depends on the volume of the body. It is
an intuitive notion and is ﬂexible to yield strong minimax lower
bounds; 2. The connection between the approximation radius
and the Kolmogorov width is a consequence of a novel duality
relationship on the Kolmogorov width, developed by utilizing
some classical results from convex geometry [1], [18], [6].

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper, we study the minimax risk of estimators over
symmetric convex polytopes. We show that for a symmetric
convex polytope deﬁned by m hyperplanes, the truncated
series estimator, a well-known special type of linear estimator,
is within O(log m) factor of the optimal.
In non-parametric statistics, the minimax risk of an estimator measures the worst case expected loss of the estimator for
input coming from some subset X ⊆ Rn (see Section II-B
for a formal deﬁnition). Tremendous work has been done on
understanding the optimal minimax risk for various families
of X. But it is usually very difﬁcult to design the optimal
estimator. Truncated series estimators are a family of linear
estimators that simply project an observation to a properly
chosen subspace. Despite its simplicity, the truncated series
estimator is surprisingly powerful and is shown to be nearly
optimal for wide families of convex bodies. [16] shows that
such estimator is nearly optimal for ellipsoids. In [4], it
is shown that it is nearly optimal for the wider family of
orthosymmetric and quadratically convex objects, including p
balls for p ≥ 2. Another family of sets for which minimax risk
has been explored are the full approximation sets. Lorentz [10]
proposed metric entropy bounds on this family. Using these
bounds, Yang and Barron [21] showed that truncated series
estimators indeed achieve near optimal minimax risk over
these sets.
In this paper, we show that the power of truncated series
estimator extends to the rich class of symmetric polytopes.

|xi+1 − xi | ≤ L |ti+1 − ti |, for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

(1)

These constraints indeed deﬁne a symmetric convex polytope
X = {x : |xi+1 − xi | ≤ L |ti+1 − ti |, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} .
When the sampling is uniform, i.e. ti = (i − 1)/(n − 1),
then X has a more special form of X = {x : |xi+1 − xi | ≤
L/(n − 1)}. In this case, previous work [13], [19] has shown
that the best truncated series estimator is nearly optimal. As
a consequence of our work, the truncated series estimator is
nearly optimal (within O(log n) factor) for estimating Lipschitz function at arbitrary sample set {t1 , . . . , tn }. In addition,
this extends to higher order Lipschitz or continuity conditions
as those conditions can be represented as nO(1) symmetric
linear constraints.
At the high level, the proof of our results follows a very
simple strategy. We choose a family of “obstruction objects”
for which we can obtain lower bounds of the minimax risk.
Then we show a “duality” result that if X does not have a good
truncated series estimator, then it will have to contain a “large”
obstruction, and therefore no estimator can do well on X. Of
course, the difﬁculty is in choosing the obstruction so that
we can prove the corresponding duality result. Some natural
obstructions include hyper-rectangles and Euclidean balls, for
which we know very tight minimax lower bound. But they turn
out to be too restrictive to allow a strong enough duality result.
To overcome this difﬁculty, we consider a broader family
consisting of objects which contain a “non-negligible” fraction

of a “large” Euclidean ball; whence we are able to establish
a desired duality relationship.
More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst deﬁne a geometric measure for
any set, called approximation radius, and then develop a lower
bound technique which bounds the minimax risk of any body
by its approximation radius. Intuitively, the approximation
radius of an object X is the maximum radius of a ball with
“non-negligible” volume fraction inside X. By reﬁning the
technique in [21], [17], we can show that the minimax risk
of X is asymptotically as large as that of the ball with X’s
approximation radius (see Theorem III.2). On the other hand,
the minimax risk of truncated series estimator is determined by
the Kolmogorov width of the object. Our bound is then derived
by showing that the approximation radius is asymptotically
close to the Kolmogorov widths for the symmetric polytopes
(see Theorem III.5). For the connection, we ﬁrst derive a
duality relationship between the Kolmogorov widths of X and
its polar dual X ◦ (see Theorem III.4), by utilizing some results
from convex geometry started in [1]. The Kolmogorov width of
X ◦ is then shown, by probabilistic arguments, to be intimately
related to the approximation radius of X.

approximation radius of that body. Compared to the existing
lower bound techniques, such as the Bernstein bound and the
bound followed from considering the worst (typically discrete)
distributions (see [13], [19] and [3], [5]), the approximation
radius relies on a volume estimation and is both convenient to
operate and ﬂexible to provide strong lower bounds.
One center piece in this paper is the connection established
between the approximation radius and the Kolmogorov width.
Towards this step, we use some results developed in Banach
space geometry which was initialized in [1] for investigating
the invertibility of matrices with large “robust” rank and
subsequently developed by [18], [6]. In particular, we show
a duality relationship between the Kolmogorov widths of a
convex body and its polar dual body. Our result has a similar
ﬂavor to the classical duality in [12] but is tighter when the
dimension gap is small.
B. Organization
Due to space limitations, most of the details in the proofs are
omitted from this abstract and can be found in [8]. But we will
present all the deﬁnitions (Section II) and results (Section III)
as well as crucial steps in proving our results (Section IV).
We will also discuss some applications and open questions in
Section V.
II. P RELIMINARIES

A. Related work
There is a vast body of work on the minimax estimators and
it is beyond the scope of this paper to survey them. We refer
to [13], [19], [9] for comprehensive survey and will describe
some work most relevant to this paper. Since we focus on the
mean squared error (MSE), all the subsequent discussion is in
the context of MSE.
The minimax bounds have been developed for various
families of convex bodies through intensive research in the
past decades. Asymptotically tight bounds have been proposed
for convex bodies that correspond to various continuity or
energy conditions; the classes of H¨ lder balls, Sobolev balls,
o
and Besov balls. We refer to Chapter 2.8 in [19] for a comprehensive recount of the references. Despite these remarkable
results, it is still largely unknown how to compute the minimax
risk for an arbitrary convex body. Some previous work does
attempt to deal with less speciﬁc objects (see [17] and the
references therein), but all the optimality results are under
(fairly strong) isometric assumption about the objects.
On the other hand, the truncated series estimator has a
nice geometric interpretation and is related to the classical
Kolmogorov width of the underlying object. In addition to
its simplicity, [4] shows that it is asymptotically optimal for
the class of orthosymmetric and quadratically convex objects.
This includes the class of diagonally stretched p balls for
p ≥ 2. Present paper shows that the power of truncated series
estimators also extend to the family of symmetric convex
polytopes, as long as the polytope is deﬁned by not so many
hyperplanes.
To achieve our result, we develop a lower bound technique
based on a geometric quantity which we dub approximation
radius. Using Fano’s inequality and the reﬁnement developed
in [21], [17], we show that the minimax risk of a convex body
is lower bounded by that of the ball with radius equal to the

For a vector x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) and a real number p ≥ 1,
denote by x p the p -norm of x, and x ∞ = maxi |xi |.

When p is absent, it means 2 norm. Let Bp (x, r) denote the
n dimensional p ball with radius r and center x. Whenever
n
the center is at the origin, it is denoted by Bp (r). Also, we
drop the superscript n, whenever the dimension is clear from
the context, and suppress the argument r for r = 1.
A set X ⊂ Rn is called centrally symmetric (or simply
symmetric) if for any x ∈ X, we have −x ∈ X. For a set X,
the 2 -radius of X is deﬁned as

In particular, when p = ∞, F∞ consists of symmetric
convex polytopes deﬁned by m hyperplanes. Throughout we
consider bounded convex bodies. Our results easily extend
to unbounded convex bodies, but the presentation would be
cumbersome including separate case analysis which does not
add any new insight.

Estimators generally can be nonlinear function. We denote
by RL (X, σ) the minimax risk when M is linear. A special
and commonly used linear estimator is the truncated series
estimator [4]. Truncated series estimator is deﬁned by M (y) =
P y for some orthogonal projection P from Rn to some lower
dimensional space. The minimax risk for truncated estimators
is deﬁned as

zc,k (X) = sup{r : vrk (X, r) ≥ c} .

Note that if X contains the origin in its interior, then
zc,k (X) is always deﬁned for 0 ≤ c ≤ 1.

Since B1 ∈ F∞ where m = 2n , we have β∞ =

main result is to provide a nearly matching upper bound
of O(log m). The upper bound is the consequence of the
following theorems: Theorem III.2 lower bounds the minimax
risk by the approximation radius; Theorems III.4, III.5 together
establish a lower bound on the approximation radius by the
Kolmogorov width, which in turn upper bounds the minimax
risk of the truncated series estimator.

The paper is mainly devoted to proving Theorems III.2,

following section, we will sketch the proof of these results.
The details can be found in [8].

C. Proof of Theorem III.5
By setting = 1/2 in Theorem III.4, we have that X contains an Ω(k)-dimension ball with radius Ω( 1/k dk (X)). In
the proof of Theorem III.5, we show that we can expand this
ball by factor k/ log m so that it still has non-negligible
intersection with X. The intuition is that in k-dimensional
space, in order to bound a sphere tightly, one needs exp(Ω(k))
hyperplanes. We use a probabilistic argument to make this
intuition rigorous.

IV. S KETCH OF P ROOFS
A. Proof of Theorem III.2
The proof is based on the information-theoretic bound
established in [21], [17]. In this technique, the minimax risk
is lower bounded by restricting to a maximal ﬁnite set of
points {x1 , · · · , xr } in X, separated from each other by at
least an amount in the loss metric. The following proposition
is from [17], [21].

D. Proof of Theorem III.1
The main theorem follows easily from all these preparations. Let k ∗ = min{k ≥ 1|dk (X)2 ≤ kσ 2 }. By Eq. (4),
RT (X, σ) ≤ dk∗ (X)2 + k ∗ σ 2 ≤ 3 min{dk∗ −1 (X)2 , k ∗ σ 2 }.
On the other hand, by Theorem III.5 and III.4,

Proposition IV.1. For any set X, let N (X) be any -net for
X and Mδ (X) be a δ-packing in X. Then,

Let rk = min{zc∗ ,k (X), kσ}, and Yk = Y ∩ B2 (rk ).
We can then provide an upper bound of N (Yk ) of Yk by
N (B2 (rk )) and a lower bound of Mδ (Yk ) by the volume
bound. Theorem III.2 then follows from Proposition IV.1.

Applying Theorem III.2, we have R(X, σ) = Ω((log m)−1 ·
min dk∗ −1 (X)2 , k ∗ σ 2 ). Combining both bounds, we have
that
RT (X, σ)

A. Applications to estimating Lipschitz functions

We take a detour to establish the connection between
the Kolmogorov width and the approximation radius. The
connection is via a novel duality relationship between the
Kolmogorov widths of X and those of its polar dual, as
stated in Theorem III.4. The proof is an application of some
celebrated works in convex geometry [1], [18], [6].

The problem of estimating values of a Lipschitz function, at
a set of sampled points, from noisy measurements is discussed
in the introduction. Since the Lipschitz condition can be represented as linear conditions, Theorem III.1 is widely applicable
to such problems. For example, the function can be deﬁned
on any metric space, the sampling points can be arbitrary set
of points, and the Lipschitz or continuity condition can be of
higher order and even include constraints with different orders.
As long as the number of corresponding linear constraints is
bounded by nO(1) for n samples, the approximation factor is
within a small factor of O(log n) of the optimal.

of δ-wide sets, and can be gleaned from [1], [18], [6].
Proposition IV.3. For any δ-wide set V = {v1 , · · · , vs }, there

different from the classical Banach-Mazur distance in which F

In this paper, we showed that the truncated series estimator
can achieve nearly optimal minimax risk for symmetric polytopes deﬁned by few hyperplanes. There are some outstanding
open questions raised by this work.

of Ω( log m/ log log m) and O(log m).

2) What is the best bound for βp
for p ≥ 2? We
conjecture it is O(log m).
3) How tight is the approximation radius bound for lower
bounding the minimax risk for convex bodies? For 1 ball, it
√
has a gap of Θ( log n). This is the largest gap we know of.
4) How to efﬁciently approximate the optimal truncated
series estimator for any symmetric polytope?

C. Tightness of the approximation radius bound

Here, we consider Bp for 1 ≤ p < 2 and show that the
lower bound of using approximation radius is very close to
the minimax upper bound but does leave a small gap of factor
of Θ((log n)1−p/2 ).
We start by computing (the order of) zc,k (X). Using a result
in [11] regarding the volume of the sections of p balls, we
have that

When σ ≤ 1, we choose k ≈ σ −p in Theorem III.2 and
n
obtain a lower bound of R(Bp , σ) = Ω(σ 2−p ). By [3], the
n
optimal upper bound for Bp is R = Θ(σ 2−p (2 log nσ p )1−p/2 )
1/ log n. Hence the approximation
for (1/n)1/p
σ
radius bound leaves a gap of Θ((log n)1−p/2 ). Actually, the
√
largest gap we know of is log n by setting p = 1 in the
above bound.
D. Computational complexity
We have shown that the truncated series estimator is close
to optimal for symmetric convex polytopes. For the family of
m,n
ellipsoids F2 , the optimal truncated series estimator can be
computed by singular value decomposition. However, computing the best truncated series estimator, or the Kolmogorov
width, for symmetric convex polytopes, is NP hard. When
k = 0, d0 (X) is the radius of X, and it is exactly the 2 -norm
maximization problem considered in [2]. As shown in [2],
for 2 ≤ p < ∞ the p -norm-maxima over (even symmetric)
polytopes cannot be computed in polynomial time within a
factor of 1.090, unless P=NP.
On the other hand, using semi-deﬁnite programming (SDP)
√
relaxation, one can compute O( log m) approximation of the
radius [7], [14], i.e. d0 (X). However, it is not known how to
approximate dk (X) for k > 1. [20] showed that if the number
√
of vertices of X is v, then SDP gives an O( log v) approximation for dk . Nevertheless, in our problem, the number of
vertices of a symmetric polytope can be exponential in n. So
the technique in [20] does not directly apply to our problem.
