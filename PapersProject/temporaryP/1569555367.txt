Abstract—The problem of multiple descriptions for a Gaussian
source is considered, in which all the decoders have access to correlated Gaussian side-information. Two variations of this problem
are studied. First, the rate-distortion tradeoff is characterized
under the assumption of a common reconstruction constraint,
in which the estimate produced at each of the decoders is also
exactly recoverable at the encoder. Secondly, a generalization of
this setup is studied in which possibly different distortions are
tolerable between the estimates at the encoder and the respective
estimates at each of the decoders.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The rate distortion function for lossy transmission of a
memoryless source X to a decoder that has access to correlated
side information Y was characterized by Wyner and Ziv
in [1]. There are two ways in which the side-information
is useful in the Wyner-Ziv problem. First, since the side
information Y is correlated with the source X, the encoder
can reduce the communication rate via binning; and secondly,
ˆ
the reconstruction X at the decoder depends on both the
digital information received from the encoder and the sideinformation Y . The second property, i.e., the dependence of
ˆ
the decoder’s estimate X on the side-information Y (which
is unavailable at the encoder) may be undesirable for certain
applications. As an example, consider the transmission of
sensitive medical records, for which it is of utmost importance
that the decoder and the encoder agree upon the estimates of
the records.
To take such scenarios into account, the problem of common
reconstruction (CR) was proposed by Steinberg in [2], in
which the rate-distortion function is characterized for a pointto-point system under a common reconstruction constraint.
Formally, a common reconstruction constraint refers to a
restriction that the encoder should also be able to reconstruct
the estimate at the decoder. The common reconstruction constraint can be perhaps too restrictive since it precludes the
decoder to use its side-information to create the estimate. A
relaxed version of the common reconstruction constraint in
which some distortion is tolerable between the estimate at the
encoder and the estimate at the decoder was studied in [3].
The corresponding rate-distortion function was characterized
in [3] (henceforth referred to as the rate-distortion function
under constrained reconstruction (ConR)).
Some generalizations and extensions of [2] to multi-user
settings have been studied recently. In particular, the ratedistortion function for the Heegard-Berger problem with CR

Multiple descriptions with side-information and CR constraints.

constraints has been recently obtained in [4]. Furthermore, the
rate-distortion tradeoff for a class of cascade source coding
problems under the CR constraint has also been obtained
in [4]. It is noted that in the latter case, the problem of
determining the rate-distortion tradeoff is open when one does
not impose the CR constraint. This demonstrates that the
CR constraint may simplify the design problem by limiting
the space of possible strategies, as already discussed in [2]
and [5]. A source coding problem with complementary side
information under a CR constraint has been studied in [6].
Joint source-channel coding for a Gaussian source over a slow
fading Gaussian broadcast channel is studied in [5], where
it is shown that the natural broadcast strategy coupled with
successive reﬁnement source coding is in fact optimal under
the CR constraint (also see [2, Sec. IV]).
In this paper, we generalize the point-to-point commonreconstruction problem of [2], and the point-to-point constrained reconstruction problem of [3] to the problem of
multiple descriptions (MD) with decoder side information. We
focus on the MD problem with three decoders, in which all the
decoders have access to the same correlated side-information
Y (see Figure 1). We focus on Gaussian source and side
information. Speciﬁcally, an encoder wishes to convey a memoryless Gaussian scalar source X to three decoders via two
rate-limited orthogonal links. The distortion constraints at all
the decoders are assumed to be measured by the mean-squared
error (MSE). The correlated side information Y , which is
assumed to be jointly Gaussian with X is available at all
the three decoders. In the absence of side-information, this
problem was solved by Ozarow [7]. Instead, the more general
case in which correlated Gaussian side-information is available
at all decoders was solved by Diggavi and Vaishampayan [8].
In this paper, we impose an additional CR constraint. We

ﬁrst characterize the set of achievable rates and distortion
tuples for the Gaussian MD problem under the CR constraint.
We next consider the ConR generalization of this setup,
in which some pre-speciﬁed MSE distortions are tolerable
between the estimates at the encoder and the corresponding
estimates at the decoders. It is shown that the optimal strategy
is based on separation, in the sense that a combination of
coding for the MD problem, followed by binning with respect
to side-information Y , is optimal.

where Z is a zero-mean, Gaussian random variable with
2
variance σZ , and independent of X. The distortion measures
are quadratic and are deﬁned as follows:

where
: X → Jj }j=1,2 are the encoding functions.
The index J1 (resp. J2 ) is received at decoder 1 (resp. decoder
2). Both the indices (J1 , J2 ) are received at decoder 0. The
decoders form their estimates as follows:
j = 1, 2, and

j = 0, 1, 2.

RDConR as the closure of the set of all achievable

This paper considers the case in which the source X is

This paper has focused on the generalization of the Gaussian multiple-description problem with side-information at the
decoders by imposing a common reconstruction constraint as
in [2] and also constrained reconstruction constraints as in [3].
These additional distortion constraints effectively control the
amount of side-information to be used in creating the source
estimate at each decoder. The complete rate-distortion tradeoff
has been characterized for the case of common-reconstruction
constraints. This result is then generalized to the constrainedreconstruction setting with MSE distortion measures at each
of the decoders. These tradeoffs reﬂect the penalty in terms
of additional communication rates of the encoder, if it seeks
to agree with the estimates at the decoders.

V. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The proof of Theorem 2 is omitted due to space limitations
and can be found in [9].
Remark 1: The optimal coding schemes achieving the
tradeoffs in Theorems 1 and 2 are based on a separation based
strategy, i.e., a combination of coding for the MD problem,
followed by binning with respect to side-information Y . This
is evident by comparing the expressions in Theorems 1 and
2 to the corresponding tradeoff regions in (8)-(10) and (14)(16). It is interesting to note that all four regions are described
by a similar set of constraints, except that the deﬁnition of
the effective distortions DNo−SI , DSI , DCR and DConR differ
depending on the problem under consideration. We also note
ConR
CR
that as De,j → 0, for j = 0, 1, 2, we have Dj
→ Dj ,
and the region in Theorem 2 collapses to the one in Theorem
1.
We illustrate these tradeoffs in Figure 2 for the symmetric
case in which D1 = D2 = D0 = Dsym , and R1 = R2 =
2
Rsym , De,1 = De,2 = De,0 = De,sym = 0.05, with σX = 4

and σZ = 1. From Figure 2, it is worth noting that for values

where (72) follows from the CR constraint and application of

Hence, from (77) and (84), and using (67), we obtain the

where in (76), we have used the fact that W n is independent
of (X n , Y n , J1 , J2 ) and the conditional version of the entropy
