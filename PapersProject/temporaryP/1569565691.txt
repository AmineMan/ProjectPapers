In [1], the main idea is to transform the broadcast channel into
two physically degraded channels. The packet reception rate
regions with feedback are given as

Abstract—A broadcast system with ACK/NAK feedback is
considered where each link is modeled as a Rayleigh fading
channel. The performance improvement is investigated if the
erroneously received packets are not discarded and the soft
information within them is exploited to reduce the number of
transmission attempts. An outer bound on the packet reception
rate region on the physical layer is provided by extending that
region on the packet layer. A new transmission algorithm is
proposed that combines log-likelihood ratios on the physical
layer with network coding. This transmission algorithm does
not require the transmitter to know any prior or instantaneous
information about the channel and considers network coding on
both the packet layer and the physical layer. Simulations show
that the transmission algorithm with soft decoding achieves rates
close to an outer bound for the packet reception rate region.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the
broadcast system model is described. Section III presents a
new packet reception rate region of the broadcast system.
Section IV proposes a new transmission algorithm involving
network coding on the physical layer. This new algorithm uses
the soft information within the erroneously received packets in
some prior time slots and it achieves rates that are close to an
outer bound for the packet reception rate region in Section III.
Simulation results are compared in Section V. Finally, Section
VI concludes the work and proposes future work.

Previous studies on broadcast channels showed that feedback can enlarge the capacity region if the links are packet
erasure channels (PEC). In [1], a transmission algorithm to
achieve the capacity was proposed. In this algorithm, based
on ACK/NAK feedback, the transmitter sends network coded
packets. The receivers decode these packets by using the
successfully decoded packets received previously. The network
coded packets provide different information for different users
simultaneously and hence increase rate. Nevertheless, due
to the channel model (PEC), only the successfully decoded
packets are used to retrieve information from the network
coded packets.
In this work1 , we extend the system so that not only
successfully decoded packets are used during decoding, but
also the packets that were not decodable. For this purpose, we
change the channel model from a PEC with erasure probability
’ ’ to a Rayleigh fading channel with outage probability
’Pout = ’, so that we can exploit the soft information of
the received packets even if an outage occurs. We derive the
packet reception rate region for our model and also extend the
transmission algorithm given in [1] for the new channel model.
The packet reception rate of a user is deﬁned as the number
of successful packet transmissions over the total number of
transmission attempts.
The capacity regions of broadcast channels are studied in [3]
and [4]. The paper [5] shows that the capacity of a physically
degraded channel cannot increase by using feedback, but the
broadcast channel is not physically degraded in general. The
capacity regions of broadcast PECs are studied in [1], [6], [7].

Consider a Rayleigh block fading broadcast system with a
single transmitter and two users. The transmitter has packets
for user A and packets for user B, but no common packets.
Uncoded packets are encoded to coded packets with packet
length P L bits. The coded packets are broadcast in a unit
time slot. At the end of each transmission, user i, i ∈ {A, B},
knows whether an outage occurs and informs the transmitter
about the reception state Zi . Similarly as in [1] and [7], Zi = 1
if an outage occurs for user i, and Zi = 0 otherwise.
The channel between the transmitter and user i is modeled
as yi = ai hi x + ni , where ai describes the pathloss and yi
and x are vectors containing receive and transmit samples,
respectively. Signal x has a transmit signal power ES . hi
is an independent Rayleigh fading coefﬁcient (known to the
2
receivers) with hi ∼ Rayleigh(σR ) and ni is a Gaussian
2
noise vector with variance σn . The Rayleigh fading channel is
both time-ﬂat and frequency-ﬂat and hi is constant on blocks
of packet size. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is deﬁned as

1) Transforming a PEC to a Rayleigh Fading Channel:
In order to show the improvements due to combining the
soft information, we compare our transmission strategy with
the algorithm given in [1] which assumes a PEC. We use a
Rayleigh fading channel which has similar physical parameters
as the PEC.
Consider transmitting with ﬁxed power and rate and a
decoder with an SNR threshold of γ. For simplicity, the γ
is a sharp threshold that distinguishes perfectly reliable and
completely unreliable communication. The packet error rate
(P ER) of the decoder with respect to γi is thus

2) Combining Multiple Received Copies: A soft information combining scheme combines multiple received copies
of the same transmitted signal weighted by the SNR. This
scheme is similar to Chase combining in Hybrid-ARQ systems
[8]. Retransmissions are performed if users feedback NAK
messages. This scheme can be implemented by combining
soft values of different received transmission attempts at the
decoder.
In the following, we derive the expected number of transmission attempts until a packet is decoded correctly by user i
(Ei ) and by at least one of the two users in a broadcast system
(EBC ).

Similar to [1], we transform the broadcast channel with
feedback into two physically degraded channels. Consider a
broadcast channel C and deﬁne a physically degraded channel
C with Z1 = ZA ZB of output 1 and Z2 = ZA of output 2. For
channel C, an outage to output 1 occurs only when outages to
both outputs in channel C occur. From the deﬁnition of EBC

output 2 is 1/EA . Deﬁne

We remark that this outer bound is not necessarily an outer
bound of the underlying broadcast channel with feedback, but
it does outer bound the packet reception rate region with our
transmission strategy.

This section presents a transmission algorithm with soft
decoding involving network coding applied on the physical
layer. Before describing the algorithm in detail, we ﬁrst
consider soft combining.

Pxor = PA ⊕ PB = Fenc (UA ) ⊕ Fenc (UB ) = Fenc (UA ⊕ UB ).
(16)
In the considered transmission algorithm, the soft information, i.e. log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of packets is calculated.
The LLR L is deﬁned as:

k ∈ {A, B, xor}, 1 ≤ j ≤ P L.

LLR of PA from the LLR of Pxor , if packet PB is known
and combine all LLRs of PA together. We take the boxplus

from LLR algebra [9]2 . The LLR L(CPxor ) of a

In the following, we present the transmission algorithm
with soft decoding. The transmitting strategy is similar to
Algorithm III given in [1] and we repeat it for the sake of
completeness. However, instead of discarding the erroneously
received packets, the users use their soft information and
calculate the LLR jointly.
There are two phases in the algorithm. During the ﬁrst
phase, the transmitter broadcasts the packets of A and B.
According to the feedback from the receivers, the transmitter
knows which packets are received by which users correctly. If
each user has a correctly received packet addressed to the other
user and those packets are received erroneously at their actual
destination, the transmitter generates XORed packets out of
those two packets and multicasts them to both users. At the
end of this phase, one user has received all the packets, which
are addressed to that user. In the second phase, the transmitter
only transmits remaining packets to the other user that has not
received all the packets addressed to that user. The details of
the two phases will be presented later.
Each transmission attempt contains two steps. In the ﬁrst
step, after informing the users about three control bits and
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) bits, the transmitter broadcasts the coded packet with length P L bits. In the second
step, the transmitter and users are all informed of the reception
states of both users (ACK/NAK messages). The control bits,
the CRC bits and the ACK/NAK messages are well protected
as if transmitting through a perfect error-free channel. We
assume that the number of those bits is neglectable compared
to the packet length. These bits are set as follows:
• Control bits b0 , b1 , b2 indicate the phase (1 or 2), XOR
operation (XORed or non-XORed) and destination (user
A or B, if it is non-XORed) of the packet respectively
(the same as Algorithm III given in [1]).

Consider the soft information combination of three coded
packets, PA , PB and Pxor = PA ⊕ PB . If Fenc is the
encoding function for uncoded packet U with ﬁxed length
U L, the output coded packet P with ﬁxed length P L satisﬁes
P = Fenc (U ). For our decoding algorithm, the encoding
function Fenc should be linear, like Turbo Codes. This means
that, for a XORed packet Pxor , we have

where Lprior (CPA ) and L(CPxor ) can be the arithmetic sum

If a user receives a XORed packet Pxor and has full side
information about one original packet PB , it is able to further
increase the LLR of the other packet PA by calculating the
LLR (21) jointly. The transmission algorithm, which will be
introduced in the next section, is based on such a joint LLR
calculation method.

CRC bits are used for users to check whether they
successfully decoded the packets.
• Zi is a one bit ACK/NAK message of user i about its
reception state. Zi = 1 means that an outage has occured
and Zi = 0, otherwise. For simplicity, we deﬁne the states
of feedback F = (ZA , ZB ) as:
F00 = (0, 0), F10 = (1, 0), F01 = (0, 1), F11 = (1, 1).
There are three kinds of side information in this algorithm.
The ﬁrst one is a correctly decoded packet addressed to the
other user, similar to PB in (21). The second one is the soft
information of the demanded packet before receiving a XORed
j
packet, similar to Lprior (CPA ) in (21). Those two kinds are
used for calculating the LLR jointly. The last kind is the soft
information for combining multiple received copies. It helps to
increase the effective SNR of the current transmission attempt
at the decoder, if the same signal is transmitted multiple
times. The following four kinds of buffers are needed for the
transmission and each of them contains information about at
most one packet.
Transmitter Side:
Uncoded packet buffers QA and QB : Those buffers are used
according to the feedback from the users. QA is either empty
or contains an uncoded packet addressed to user A. This packet
is transmitted in some prior time slots, erroneously received
by user A, but correctly received by user B. QB is similar
deﬁned by reversing the roles of A and B. These buffers are
used to generate network coded packets. We deﬁne the buffer
states S = (QA , QB ) as:

Transmitter: Transmitter takes different actions according
to the buffer state S, the same as Algorithm III in [1]. Before
transmitting the coded packet, it informs the users about the
received packet’s control bits and CRC bits. After getting the
feedback from both users, the transmitter will inform the users
about the reception state. Each packet is retransmitted until at
least one of the users receives it.
1) If S = S00 or S01 , transmitter sends out a coded packet
PA = Fenc (UA ) for user A.
(a) If F = F10 , uncoded packet UA is moved to QA .
2) If S = S10 , transmitter sends out a coded packet PB =
Fenc (UB ) for user B.
(a) If F = F01 , uncoded packet UB is moved to QB .
3) If S = S11 , transmitter sends out a XORed packet
Pxor = Fenc (QA ⊕ QB ).
(a) If F = F00 , remove uncoded packets in QA , QB .
(b) If F = F10 , remove uncoded packet in QB .
(c) If F = F01 , remove uncoded packet in QA .
User A: User A takes different actions according to the
received packet’s control bits. The channel decoder’s input, the
LLR value, is calculated jointly. After decoding the packet,
CRC bits are used to check the reception state and user A
feedbacks this reception state.
1) If the received packet is addressed to itself (PA ), the
j
LLR values L(CPA )s of PA are the input of the channel
j
decoder, where L(CPA )s are the sum of LLR values in
the QRe and received packet.
(a) If F = F00 or F01 , QRe is set to zero.
j
(b) If F = F10 , L(CPA )s are copied to QSP , replacing
any exist value. QRe is set to zero.
j
(c) If F = F11 , L(CPA )s are copied to QRe .
2) If the received packet is addressed to user B (PB ), the
j
LLR values L(CPB )s of PB are the input of the channel
j
decoder, where L(CPB )s are the sum of LLR values in
the QRe and received packet.
(a) If F = F00 or F01 , UB of PB is copied to QB ,
replacing any existing packets. QRe is set to zero.
(b) If F = F10 , QRe is set to zero.
j
(c) If F = F11 , L(CPB )s are copied to QRe .
3) If the received packet is a XORed packet (Pxor ), the new
j
LLR values (Ljoint (CPA ))s are the input of the channel
j
decoder. Ljoint (CPA ) is calculated according to (21).
j
The CPB s is recovered by encoding UB in QB . The
j
j
Lprior (CPA ) is stored in the QSP . The L(CPxor ) is the
sum of LLR values in the QRe and current transmission
attempt. Here, after getting UA , the CRC is performed
on UA ⊕ UB .
(a) If F = F00 or F01 , a packet addressed to user A is
recovered. QRe is set to zero.
j
(b) If F = F10 , Ljoint (CPA ) is copied to QSP . QRe is
set to zero.
j
(c) If F = F11 , L(CPxor ) is copied to QRe .
User B: Similar actions as user A, with roles of A and B,
F10 and F01 reversed.

•

S00 = (0, 0), S10 = (1, 0), S01 = (0, 1), S11 = (1, 1),
where 1 means the buffer contains a packet and 0 means the
buffer empty.
Receiver Side: For user A (user B is similarly deﬁned by
reversing the roles of A and B):
Uncoded packet buffer QB : This buffer contains at most
one uncoded packet addressed to user B, erroneously received
by user B, but correctly received by user A. Before receiving
a network coded packet, QB stores the same uncoded packet
as QB .
Retransmission LLR buffer QRe : This buffer is used for
combining multiple received copies. The soft information
contained in it can help to increase the effective SNR of
retransmissions at the decoder.
Side Packet LLR buffer QSP : This buffer contains the erroj
neously received demanded packets’ LLR values (Lprior (CPA )
in (21)). It is used for calculating LLR jointly and provides
the erroneously received demanded packet’s LLR value.
As mentioned above, there are two phases in the algorithm.
For the operation of the algorithm, no prior or instantaneous
information about channel is required at the transmitter. The
actions of the transmitter and users in each phase are described
as follows.
Phase 1
This phase runs until at least one of the users can receive
all of its demanded packets.

Packet reception rate rB

efﬁcient. Meanwhile, a new transmission algorithm with soft
decoding involving network coding applied on the physical
layer is proposed. The resulting transmission algorithm with
soft decoding achieves rates close to the outer bound of the
packet reception rate region. By comparing with the packet
reception rate region on the packet layer without exploiting
discarded soft information, the proposed algorithm shows a
signiﬁcant performance improvement.
In this work, the transmission rate is not optimized for
both users simultaneously. In our transmission algorithm with
soft decoding, we use a ﬁxed transmission rate in each
transmission. Hence, adaptive transmission rates schemes with
incremental redundancy and soft information combining might
give even better performance. This is an interesting direction
to optimize the transmission rate for both users.

V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
We present simulation results and compare them with the
theoretical bounds given in Section III and the result of [1]
(which were based on a PEC model).
In order to fulﬁll the requirement (5), we choose Turbo
codes as our channel code, since Turbo codes have very steep
P ER vs SN R curves, which approximately gives (5). For
our simulation, we take a UMTS Turbo encoder with packet
length P L = 4500 bits and coding rate R = 1/3. We modulate
the signal with BPSK. We choose γ = 0.34125, which we
derived empirically from the simulations of a point-to-point
communication with the Turbo code with given parameters.
Fig. 1 depicts the simulation results when using the transmission algorithm with soft decoding (Section IV-B), the
Algorithm III in [1], the outer bound derived in (15), the
broadcast PEC with feedback on the packet layer (3) and
the naive time-sharing on the packet layer [1]. The packet
erasure rates on the packet layer of the users are A = 0.45
and B = 0.55. Then according to (6), the parameters in
2
2
the simulation are ES = 1, σn = 1/0.34125, σR = 1,
aA = 0.9145 and aB = 0.7913 as in Section II.
The proposed transmission algorithm with soft decoding on
the physical layer achieves the points close to the outer bound
of the packet reception rate region given in (15) and has a
much better performance than the algorithm on the packet
layer in [1]. By exploiting the erroneously received packets’
soft information, the required number of retransmissions is
reduced and the packet reception rate region is extended
signiﬁcantly.
