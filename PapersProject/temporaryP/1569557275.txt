channels for the wiretapper are more noisy than the legitimate
receiver, which shares a secret key with the encoder.
It is a well-known fact that the feedback does not increase
the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). However, does the feedback increase the secrecy capacity of the
wiretap channel? To solve this problem, R. Ahlswede and N.
Cai studied the wiretap channels with noiseless feedback from
the legitimate receiver [1], where both upper bound and lower
bound of the secrecy capacity were provided. The lower bound
is proved to be tight, while the upper bound is only tight
for some special cases. Speciﬁcally, for the degraded wiretap
channel, the secrecy capacity satisﬁes

Abstract—The non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless
feedback is ﬁrst investigated by R. Ahlswede and N. Cai, where
lower and upper bounds on the secrecy capacity are provided
in their work. However, the capacity-equivocation region has not
been determined yet. In this paper, the capacity-equivocation
region is determined for the non-degraded wiretap channel with
noiseless feedback. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity of this
model is formulated, which provides the best transmission rate
with perfect secrecy.
Index Terms—Capacity region, non-degraded wiretap channel,
noiseless feedback, secrecy capacity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The concept of the wiretap channel was ﬁrst introduced by
A. D. Wyner [9]. It is a kind of degraded broadcast channel.
The wiretapper knows the encoding scheme used at the transmitter and the decoding scheme used at the legitimate receiver.
The object is to describe the rate of reliable communication
from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver, subject to a
constraint of the equivocation to the wiretapper.
After the publication of A. D. Wyner’s work, I. Csisz´r
a
and J. K¨ rner [5] investigated a more general situation: the
o
broadcast channels with conﬁdential messages. It is clear
that A. D. Wyner’s wiretap channel is a special case of the
model of I. Csisz´r and J. K¨ rner, in a manner that the main
a
o
channel is less noisy than the wiretap channel. In addition,
the secrecy capacity of the non-degraded wiretap channel was
also formulated in [5], which provides the best transmission
rate with perfect secrecy. Based on A. D. Wyner’s work,
S. K. Leung-Yan-Cheong and M. E. Hellman studied the
Gaussian wiretap channel (GWC) [4], and showed that its
secrecy capacity was the difference between the main channel
capacity and the overall wiretap channel capacity (the cascade
of main channel and wiretap channel). Recently, C. Mitrpant
et al. [7] and Y. Chen et al. [3] studied wiretap channel
with noncausal channel state information, where both of them
focused on achievable regions. In addition, N. Merhav [8]
studied a speciﬁc wiretap channel, and obtained the capacity
region, where both the legitimate receiver and the wiretapper
have access to some leaked symbols from the source, but the

Cs = max min{I(X; Y ), H(Y |Z)},
p(x)

(1.1)

where X, Y and Z are input of the main channel, output of the
main channel and output of the wiretap channel, respectively.
In addition, the wiretap channel with noisy feedback was
studied in [6], and the wiretap channel with secure rate-limited
feedback was studied in [2], and both of them focused on
bounds of the secrecy capacity.
In this paper, we study the model of non-degraded
wiretap channel with noiseless feedback, see Figure 1. In
this model, the i-th time input of the main channel Xi depends
not only on the message W , but also on the previous outputs
of the main channel Y i−1 . The wiretapper can observe Xi via
a wiretap channel, see Figure 1.
The capacity region considering transmission rate and
equivocation, is determined for the model of Figure 1. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity of this model is formulated, which
provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.
The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present the basic deﬁnitions and the main result
of the capacity region (including the secrecy capacity). In
Section III, we prove the converse half of Theorem 1. The
direct half of Theorem 1 is proved in Section IV. Section
V shows the capacity regions of two special cases. Final
conclusions are presented in Section VI.

we say that the wiretap channel is more capable than the main

II. N OTATIONS , D EFINITIONS AND THE M AIN R ESULTS

Our problem in the model of Figure 1 is to characterize the
set R of all achievable (R, Re ) pairs. The following Theorem
1 gives a characterization of the set R, which is proved in the
remaining sections. The secrecy capacity in the new model of
Figure 1 is deﬁned in Remark 1 (see (2.4)), which is calculated
by the formula (2.5).
Theorem 1: • If the main channel is more capable than
the wiretap channel, the capacity region R, as deﬁned
above, is equal to R∗ , where

Throughout the paper, random variab1es, sample values and
alphabets are denoted by capital letters, lower case letters
and calligraphic letters, respectively. A similar convention is
applied to the random vectors and their sample values. For
example, U N denotes a random N -vector (U1 , ..., UN ), and
uN = (u1 , ..., uN ) is a speciﬁc vector value in U N , which
is the N th Cartesian power of U. Let pV (v) denote the
probability mass function P r{V = v}, v ∈ V.
In this section, a description of the model of Figure 1 is
given by Deﬁnition 1 to Deﬁnition 5. The achievable (R, Re )
pair is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6, and the capacity region R
composed of all achievable (R, Re ) pairs is characterized in
Theorem 1.
Deﬁnition 1: (channel encoder) The message W is uniformly distributed over W. The feedback Y i−1 is the previous
i-1 time output of the main channel, and it is available at the
channel encoder. At the i-th time, the inputs of the channel
encoder are W and Y i−1 , while the output is Xi . The i-th
time channel encoder is a mapping fi : W × Y i−1 → Xi .
Deﬁnition 2: (main channel) The main channel is a DMC
with ﬁnite input alphabet X , ﬁnite output alphabet Y, and
transition probability QM (y|x), where x ∈ X , y ∈ Y.
∏N
QM (y N |xN ) = n=1 QM (yn |xn ). The input of the main
channel is X N , while the output is Y N .
Deﬁnition 3: (wiretap channel) The wiretap channel is
also a DMC with ﬁnite input alphabet X , ﬁnite output alphabet
Z, and transition probability QW (z|x), where y ∈ Y, x ∈ X .
The input and output of the wiretap channel are X N and Z N ,
respectively. The equivocation to the wiretapper is deﬁned as
1
∆ = H(W |Z N ).

(2.3)

R∗ = {(R, Re ) : 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y ),
0 ≤ Re ≤ R,
Re ≤ H(Y |Z)}.
•

If the wiretap channel is more capable than the main
channel, the capacity region R, as deﬁned above, is equal
to R∗∗ , where
R∗∗ = {(R, Re ) : 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y ),
0 ≤ Re ≤ R,
Re ≤ H(Y |X)}.

Remark 1: There are some notes on Theorem 1, see the
following.
• The region R is convex, and it is easy to be checked by
using a switch function, thus the proof is omitted here.
• Secrecy capacity

A transmission rate Cs denoted by

Cs =

is called secrecy capacity in the model of Figure 1, and
note that Re = R implies perfect secrecy. Furthermore,
′
for case 1, Cs satisﬁes

(2.2)

′

The perfect secrecy is achieved when H(W |Z N ) = H(W ).
Note that, W → X N → (Y N , Z N ) and Y N → X N → Z N
are two Markov chains in the model of Figure 1.
Deﬁnition 4: (the relation of the main channel and the
wiretap channel) Similar to the deﬁnitions in [5], the relation
“the main channel is more capable than the wiretap channel”
is characterized by I(X N ; Z N ) ≤ I(X N ; Y N ), and otherwise

Cs = max min{H(Y |Z), I(X; Y )}.

(2.5)

′

For case 2, Cs satisﬁes
′

Cs = max min{H(Y |X), I(X; Y )}.

The proof is obvious from (2.4) and Theorem 1, thus it
is omitted here.

•

If the wiretap channel is more capable than the main
channel, the secrecy capacity of the non-degraded wiretap
channel without feedback reduces to zero. However, for
the feedback model, the secrecy capacity still satisﬁes
(2.6), and this is because the noiseless feedback is used as
a secret key shared by the transmitter and the legitimate
receiver, while the wiretapper does not know the key.
Therefore, by using feedback, the secrecy capacity is
enhanced.
For the degraded wiretap channel, R. Ahlswede and N.
Cai [1] proved that the secrecy capacity satisﬁes Cs =
min max{H(Y |Z), I(X; Y )}, and it is coincident with
the above (2.5).
Because of the restriction Y → X → Z, the conception
“non-degraded wiretap channel” of this paper is included
in the “general wiretap channel”. The capacity region of
the general wiretap channel with noiseless feedback is
still unknown.

Then we will show that (R, Re ) ∈ R∗ or (R, Re ) ∈ R∗∗ .

A. Code Construction

and it satisﬁes

Given a pair (R, Re ), choose a probability mass function
pX (x) such that 0 ≤ Re ≤ R, 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y ) and Re ≤
H(Y |Z) or Re ≤ H(Y |X). The message W is uniformly
distributed over W, let ∥W∥ = 2N R .
Generate a set RK composed of 2N I(X;Y ) sequences of
N
x , and each of them is i.i.d. generated according to pX (x).
Meanwhile, generate a mapping gf : Y N → W. Deﬁne a
random variable K = gf (Y N ), which is uniformly distributed
over W, and K is independent with W . In addition, divide
the set RK into ∥W∥ subsets, and each subset RK,i (1 ≤
i ≤ ∥W∥) corresponds to a speciﬁc value in W. There are
2N (I(X;Y )−R) sequences in each subset. Reveal the mapping
gf to the legitimate receiver, wiretapper and the transmitter.
We use the block Markov coding method. The random
vectors X N , Y N , and Z N consist of n blocks of length N .

The decoding scheme for the two cases is obvious. In the

key Ki , he can decode the transmitted message as w.

By using the above deﬁnitions and (4.2), it is easy to verify
that limN →∞ log∥W∥ = R. Then, observing the construction
N
of X N , it is easy to see that the codewords of X N is upperbounded by 2N I(X;Y ) . Therefore, from the standard channel
coding theorem, for any given ϵ > 0 and sufﬁciently large N ,
we have Pe ≤ ϵ. It remains to show that limN →∞ ∆ ≥ Re ,
see the following.
Let Zi (1 ≤ i ≤ n) be the output of the wiretap channel
for block i, and let Z n = (Z1 , ..., Zn ), Z i = (Z1 , ..., Zi ,
n
Zi+1 = (Zi+1 , ..., Zn (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Analogously, let Y n =
(Y1 , ..., Yn ). Deﬁne X n = (X1 , ..., Xn ).
For case 1, we have

where Wi (2 ≤ i ≤ n) are i.i.d. random variables uniformly
distributed over W.
In the ﬁrst block, the transmitter randomly choose a sequence xN from RK to transmit. In the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n),
the transmitter receives the output y N of the i-1-th block,
then he computes ki = gf (y N ) ∈ W. For a given wi , the
transmitter randomly choose a sequence xN from the subset
RK,i=wi ⊕ki to transmit, where ⊕ is the modulo addition over
W. Note that ki is a speciﬁc value for the random variable K
used at the i-th block (2 ≤ i ≤ n). Since K is independent
with Wi , and K, Wi are uniformly distributed in W, then we
have that K ⊕ Wi is independent with K and Wi .
(Case 1) For case 1, there are 2N I(X;Y ) codewords of
N
x , and 2N I(X;Y ) > 2N I(X;Z) , therefore, the wiretapper can
not decode xN correctly with error probability tending to
zero. However, he can guess the speciﬁc vector y N from the
N
conditional typical set T[Y |Z]δ (z N ), because the probability
N
that y N ∈ T[Y |Z]δ (z N ) tends to 1, as δ → ∞. By using
the property of strong AEP, we know that the number of
N
y N ∈ T[Y |Z]δ (z N ) is about 2N H(Y |Z) .
(Case 2) Since I(X, Y ) ≤ I(X; Z), the wiretapper can
decode the transmitted xN correctly with error probability
tending to zero. Therefore, for the given xN and z N , he
can guess the speciﬁc vector y N in the conditional typical
N
set T[Y |X,Z]δ′ (xN , z N ), because the probability that y N ∈
N
T[Y |X,Z]δ′ (xN , z N ) tends to 1, as N → ∞. By using the
property of strong AEP, we know that the number of y N ∈
N
T[Y |X,Z]δ′ (xN , z N ) is about 2N H(Y |X,Z) =(a) 2N H(Y |X) ,
where (a) is from the fact that given X, Y is independent
with Z.

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the model of non-degraded wiretap
channel with noiseless feedback. The capacity region considering transmission rate and equivocation, is determined for this
new model. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity is formulated,
which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that even if the wiretap channel is more
capable than the main channel, with the help of the feedback
as a shared secret key, the perfect secrecy can also be achieved.
However, for the case that the wiretap channel is more
capable than the main channel, the converse proof of Theorem 1 depends on the deterministic property of the channel
encoder. Since the randomization may increase the capacityequivocation region, generalizing the result of this paper
according to a random channel encoder is our future work.

A. Example 1
In this subsection, we assume that the wiretap channel is
noiseless, and the main channel is a BSC with cross-over
probability p0 . The capacity region of this case is characterized
as follows.
R∗∗

= {(R, Re ) : 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y )
= H(Y ) − H(Y |X) ≤ 1 − h(p0 ),
0 ≤ Re ≤ R,
Re ≤ H(Y |X) = h(p0 )}.

The secrecy capacity is Cs = min{1 − h(p0 ), h(p0 )}.
B. Example 2
In this subsection, we assume that the wiretap channel is a
BSC with cross-over probability p1 , and the main channel is
noiseless. The capacity region of this case is characterized as
follows.
R∗∗

= {(R, Re ) : 0 ≤ R ≤ I(X; Y )
= H(X) ≤ 1,
0 ≤ Re ≤ R,
Re ≤ H(Y |Z) = H(X|Z) = H(Z|X) +
H(X) − H(Z) ≤ h(p1 )}.

The secrecy capacity is Cs = h(p1 ).
