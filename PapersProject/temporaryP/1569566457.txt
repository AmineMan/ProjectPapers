Abstract—Collaborative spectrum sensing is vulnerable to the
Byzantine attack. Existing reputation based countermeasures will
become incapable when malicious users dominate the network.
Also, there is a scarcity of methods that fully explore the Markov
property of the spectrum states to restrain sensors’ statistical misbehaviors. In this paper, a new malicious user detection method
based on two proposed Conditional Frequency Check (CFC)
statistics is developed with a Markovian spectrum model. With
the assistance of one trusted sensor, the proposed method can
achieve high malicious user detection accuracy in the presence
of arbitrary percentage of malicious users, and thus signiﬁcantly
improves collaborative spectrum sensing performance.

(e.g., [10,12,14]), or focus their analysis on one time slot
and ignore the correlation between the spectrum states at
consecutive time slots (e.g., [3,5–8,11]). In [13], the Markov
property of the spectrum is incorporated into the malicious
user detection algorithm; however, it is generally difﬁcult to
obtain the required prior knowledge of the true spectrum in
practice.
In this paper, a global decision independent method, the
Conditional Frequency Check (CFC), is proposed based on a
Markov spectrum model to combat the Byzantine attacks. In
particular, two CFC statistics, which explore the second order
property of the Markov model, are constructed in this paper.
The corresponding analysis proves that these two proposed
CFC statistics together with an auxiliary hamming distance
check are capable of detecting any sensor that misbehaves.
In addition, two consistent histogram estimators based on the
history of sensors’ reports are also developed for these two
CFC statistics. With the aid of one trusted sensor, the proposed
method is capable of detecting any malicious sensor with high
accuracy regardless of the portion of malicious ones in the
sensor group, without requiring any prior knowledge of the
spectrum and sensing models.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II formulates the problem. The proposed malicious sensor
detection method and the corresponding theoretical analysis
are presented in Section III. Some supporting simulation
results are presented in Section IV, and Section V concludes
the paper.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Various collaborative spectrum sensing schemes have been
proposed to overcome the unreliability of single user spectrum
sensing [1]. Along with all the beneﬁts, collaborative spectrum
sensing also induces security vulnerabilities [2], among which
the Byzantine attack [3] (a.k.a. spectrum sensing data falsiﬁcation (SSDF) attack [4]) is the focus of this paper.
Many existing defenses against Byzantine attacks are reputation based, e.g., [5–8]. In this type of methods, lower
reputations will be assigned to sensors that deviate from the
global decision to mitigate the negative effects of the malicious
sensors. However, the underlying assumption is that the global
decision is correct, which may not be true when malicious
sensors dominate the network. In fact, it has been shown in
[3] [9] that when Byzantine attackers in the network exceed
a certain fraction, such reputation based methods become
completely incapable. 1 Non-reputation based approaches have
also been proposed, such as [10–12]. However, these methods
still rely on the correctness of the global decision and hence
only investigate the scenarios where a small fraction of users
are malicious. When the majority are not trustworthy, global
decision independent approaches are more suitable. Such type
of works include the prior-probability aided method proposed
in [13], and the user-centric misbehavior detection presented
in [14].
In practice usually there is memory in the spectrum state
evolvement, and the spectrum occupancy is more precisely
modeled by a Markov model. Most of the existing methods
either consider the i.i.d. spectrum state model for simplicity

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
In this paper, the following scenario is considered: 1) The
true spectrum has two states, i.e., 0 (idle) and 1 (occupied), and
follows a homogeneous Markov model with state transition
matrix A = [aij ]2×2 (i, j ∈ {0, 1}) where aij
P r(st+1 =
j|st = i) and st denotes the true spectrum state at time t. The
stationary state distribution is denoted by π = [π 0 , π1 ], which
satisﬁes πA = π. In addition, it is assumed that the Markov
chain of spectrum states is in equilibrium. 2) One trusted
honest sensor exists and is known by the fusion center. 3) All
sensors, including malicious ones, have the same spectrum
sensing capability, i.e., identical detection probabilities P d ’s
and false alarm probabilities P f a ’s.2 4) An honest sensor will
send its local sensing result directly to the fusion center. 5)

This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under
Grants CCF-0830462, ECCS-1002258 and CNS-1016260.
1 When all sensors have the same spectrum sensing capability, the reputation
based methods cannot mitigate the effect of Byzantine attacks if more than
50% sensors are malicious [3].

2 This is a common assumption in literature (e.g., [3] [10]). Defense to more
intelligent and powerful attackers remains a future work.

A malicious sensor, however, will tamper its local inference
before reporting to the fusion center. In particular, she will ﬂip
local inference from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 with probabilities ϕ 01
and ϕ10 , respectively. The ﬂipping probabilities ϕ may not
necessarily be the same for different malicious sensors. From
the fusion center’s viewpoint, the equivalent detection and
false alarm probabilities of a malicious sensor with ﬂipping
probabilities ϕ [ϕ01 , ϕ10 ] are given by

If a malicious sensor attacks, i.e., {ϕ 01 , ϕ10 } = {0, 0}, her
statistical behaviors will deviate from that of the honest sensor.
The objective of this paper is to detect the malicious sensors
by observing their statistical deviations.

A. Conditional Frequency Check
According to the preceding model, a malicious sensor has
two degrees of freedom, i.e., two parameters ϕ 01 and ϕ10 , in
launching an attack. The convectional frequency check, which
detects malicious sensors by computing their frequencies of
reporting 1 [10], enforces only one constraint to the attacker’s
behavior as indicated in Eq.(6) below. This is insufﬁcient to
prevent the malicious sensor from attacking. However, when
the true spectrum states are Markovian, the proposed CFC can
enforce two constraints by exploring the correlation between
consecutive spectrum states, and consequently identify any
ﬂipping attack easily. In particular, the CFC consists of two
statistics as deﬁned below.
Deﬁnition 1: The two conditional frequency check statistics
of a sensor are deﬁned as Ψ 1
P r(rt = 1|rt−1 = 1), and
P r(rt = 0|rt−1 = 0), respectively, where r t denotes
Ψ0
the sensor’s report at time t.
According to the deﬁnitions, these two statistics are related
to the model parameters as

In the CFC, the fusion center will evaluate Ψ 1 and Ψ0 for
every sensor and compare the resulting values with those of
the trusted sensor. If the values are sufﬁciently different, the
corresponding sensor will be identiﬁed as malicious. In the
following, the effectiveness of this statistical check is demonstrated through two analytical results, followed by a practical
approach to estimating these two statistics that eliminates the
requirement of any prior knowledge about the sensing and
spectrum models.

to the same value, i.e., Ψ (tr) . On the other hand, the CFC
statistics of any malicious sensor will converge to some value
Ψ(M) (depending on its ϕ), which is different from Ψ (tr)
according to Proposition 2. Therefore, any sensor whose CFC
statistics differs from that of the trusted sensor is malicious.
In practice, the values of the two CFC statistics between
any two honest sensors may be different due to ﬁnite detection
window length T . For this concern, only when the difference
between the CFC statistics of a sensor and those of the trusted
sensor is larger than a pre-speciﬁed threshold β CF C , will this
sensor be identiﬁed as malicious. The proposed CFC procedure
with threshold βCF C is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Consider the relation πA = π, (8) and (9) can be simpliﬁed
as

As a direct consequence of (10) and (11), ϕ ∗ + ϕ∗ = 2 must
10

hold if the malicious sensor wants to pass the CFC. On the
other hand, 0 ≤ ϕ ∗ , ϕ∗ ≤ 1 by deﬁnition. These two condi01

and the corresponding {ϕ 01 , ϕ10 } equals {1, 1}. Otherwise,
there is no valid non-zero solution for both g 1 (ϕ10 ) = 0 and
(6). That is, the malicious sensor cannot pass the CFC if she
attacks.

a blind line as indicated in Fig. 1.

Two different cases are simulated. In both cases P d = 0.9

and Pf a = 0.1, but in the ﬁrst case, A = [ 0.2 0.8 ], and
0.8 0.2 ]. Thus, the condition
in the second case, A = [ 0.4 0.6

= 1 is satisﬁed in the ﬁrst case but not in the

second one. Every malicious sensor randomly selects its own
{ϕ01 , ϕ10 } according to uniform distribution over (0, 1] 2 . The
thresholds are set as βCF C = 0.2 and βHDC = 0.3. There
are nH = 8 honest sensors and n M = 13 malicious sensors,
i.e., the malicious sensors dominate the network. The detection
window length is T = 100(time slot). At the fusion center,
the majority voting rule is used.
Simulation results of a typical run of the ﬁrst case are
shown in Fig. 2–Fig. 4. In particular, by comparing Fig. 2
and Fig. 3, it can be seen that two malicious sensors whose
ﬂipping probabilities ϕ 01 and ϕ10 are close to 1 successfully
pass the CFC. However, these two malicious sensors fail to
pass the subsequent HDC. Also, it can be seen by comparing
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 that there is one malicious user surviving both
CFC and HDC. Further examination reveals that the ﬂipping

its negative inﬂuence on the spectrum sensing result of the
fusion center is negligible.
Table I summarizes the simulation results over 100 Monte
Carlo runs for both cases. The proposed method achieves
nearly perfect sensing results in both cases, i.e., P d = 0.9956
and Pf a = 0.0006 in the ﬁrst case, and Pd = 0.9958 and
Pf a = 0.0008 in the second case, which are signiﬁcantly
better than the sensing performances of both the single trusted
sensor and that of using all sensors without malicious sensor
detection. Besides, the proposed algorithm also provides high
malicious sensor detection accuracy (η > 95%) in both cases.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
A new method consisting of two CFC statistics and an
auxiliary HDC procedure has been proposed in this paper
for malicious user detection under a Markov spectrum model.
By using the two consistent histogram estimators of the CFC
statistics, the proposed method does not require any prior
knowledge of the spectrum and sensing models for malicious
sensor detection. Both theoretical analysis and simulation
results show that the proposed method, with the assistance of
a trusted sensor, can achieve high malicious user detection accuracy, and thus signiﬁcantly improves collaborative spectrum
