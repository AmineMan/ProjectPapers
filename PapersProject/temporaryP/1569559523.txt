Abstract— This work describes an M 2 × M Zak space construction of new zero correlation zone polyphase sequence sets,
of sequence length M 3 and set size M , with all-zero crosscorrelation. The construction includes the sets with (M −1)-point,
(T2 M − 1)-point and (M 2 − 1)-point zero auto correlation zone,
where T2 is an arbitrary non-trivial factor of M . All sequences
in these sets have sparse discrete Fourier transforms with
constant non-zero magnitude at M 2 points and zero magnitude
at (M − 1)M 2 points.

certain special construction that is associated with a variable
size ZCZ auto correlation and an all-zero cross-correlation,
and is obtained by an analysis of polyphase sequences on an
M 2 × M Zak transform lattice. We call this construction the
construction A. The construction includes the sequence sets
with (M − 1)-point, (T2 M − 1)-point and (M 2 − 1)-point
zero auto correlation zone, where T2 is an arbitrary non-trivial
factor of M . All sequences in these sets have discrete Fourier
transforms with constant non-zero magnitude at M 2 points
and zero magnitude at (M − 1)M 2 points, and ﬁnite Zak
transforms with constant non-zero magnitude at M points and
zero magnitude at M 3 −M points. The compact support of the
ﬁnite Zak transforms is particularly convenient, as due to the
special structure of the Zak space cross-correlation, the support
of individual sequences in the set can be identiﬁed with a
subset of rows of the Zak transform. This correspondance
facilitates, among others, sequence storage and correlation
computation.
Apart from relevance to applications, the all-zero crosscorrelation ZCZ set is of theoretical interest, as it is in a
certain sense the dual of the perfect sequence set, the set of
sequences with ideal auto correlation. If an exact dual set to
the perfect sequence set, i.e., a polyphase set with all-zero
cross-correlation, a constant out-of-phase auto correlation, and
of dimension equal to the perfect set, exists, remains an open
problem.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section
provides a brief introduction to Zak space methods. Sections
3 and 4 describe the construction A. Section 5 contains a
comparison of the construction A with the Torii-NakamuraSuehiro construction.

Index Terms— all-zero cross-correlation, chirp-like sequence,
ﬁnite Zak transform, partial correlation, polyphase sequence,
zero correlation zone.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Design of polyphase sequence sets with good cyclic correlation properties is of considerable interest in several applications, including LTE wireless communications [9], spectrum
management [5] and multi-static radar [7]. Unfortunately, sequence sets with both ideal zero out-of-phase auto correlation
and all-zero cross-correlation do not exist [10]. While these
ideal sets are unattainable, it is possible to identify sequence
sets that are almost as good as ideal sets. These sets include:
(1) the sets of ideal auto correlation sequences with minimum
constant cross-correlation, and (2) the sets of sequences with
both auto and cross-correlation assuming a zero value for
delays contained in an interval called the zero correlation zone
(ZCZ). The former sets, which we considered previously in
[1]-[4], are called the perfect sequence sets. The latter sets,
which we focus on here, are usually referred to either as the
partial correlation or the ZCZ sequence sets.
Prior work on ZCZ sequence set design includes, among
others, [8], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], and [15]. One of the
main results in this area is the demonstration that there are
limits on the size of the ZCZ and on the size of the ZCZ set. In
particular, it was shown that for a set of M N -point polyphase
sequences, the length of the ZCZ is less than N/M [11]. The
ZCZ in most works is considered jointly, that is presuming
the same constraint applies to both auto and cross-correlation,
however, as we demonstrate here, this is not always necessary.
In this work we consider the design of ZCZ sequence sets
in Zak space. While several Zak space constructions of ZCZ
sequence sets are available (a comprehensive review of these
constructions will be given elsewhere), we focus here on a

II. F INITE Z AK TRANSFORM
Take x to be any N -periodic sequence in C N and set eL (j) :=
e2πij/L . Suppose N = LM , where L and M are positive
integers. Then the ﬁnite Zak transform (FZT) of x is given by
the formula [16]

x(k + rM )eL (rj),

We will call a sequence x having an FZT satisfying
the condition A, a construction A.

We will state, without proofs, only a few basic properties of
the FZT. For a more extensive review of Zak transform theory
and a historical background, the reader is referred to [6].
Like the DFT, the FZT is a one-to-one mapping. A signal
x can be recovered from its FZT by the formula

Fix by SX := {j0 , ..., jM−1 } ⊂ (0, 1, ..., L − 1), the
set of indices of rows of XL , ordered in k, containing the
non-zero values of XL . We will call SX the j-support of XL .

Take 0 ≤ j < L and 0 ≤ k < M for the remainder of this
paper, unless indicated otherwise. The FZT is periodic in the
frequency variable and quasi-periodic in the time variable, i.e.,
XL (j + L, k) = XL (j, k),

= (XL (j0 , 0), XL (j1 , 1), ..., XL (jM−1 , M − 1),
XL (j0 , 0)eL (−j0 ), XL (j1 , 1)eL (−j1 ), ...,

A related property describes the FZT of time and frequency
shifts of x. Set y(n) = x(n − c) and z(n) = x(n)eN (dn),
where 0 ≤ c < M and 0 ≤ d < L. Then the FZTs of y and z
are given by
YL (j, k) = XL (j, k − c)

IV. AUTO CORRELATION ZONE OF
CONSTRUCTION A
Suppose x is an N -periodic sequence in CN and z is its cyclic
auto correlation. Deﬁne the zero auto correlation zone (ZACZ)
of x as the set of consecutive integers {1, 2, ..., k}, such that
for all 1 ≤ k ′ ≤ k, z(k ′ ) = 0 and z(k + 1) = 0. We call
|ZACZ| := k the length of the ZACZ of x. We will show
next that
M − 1 ≤ |ZACZ| ≤ L − 1.

∆p = (tp , tp + L/T2 , ..., tp + (T2 − 1)L/T2 ),

(t0 , t1 , ..., tT1 −1 ) ⊂ (0, 1, ..., L/T2 − 1).

and therefore |ZACZ| = T2 M − 1. In particular, when T2 =

|ZACZ| = M − 1. In effect,

In effect, to verify the validy of (14), one only needs to assess
z(rM ) for 0 ≤ r ≤ M . We will consider two cases: when
M is a prime, and when M is not a prime.

Application of condition A to (8) constrains the non-zero
entries in the FZT of the auto correlation sequence, ZL (j, k),
to k = 0, 0 ≤ j < L, which, in turn, constrains the non-zero
entries in the auto correlation sequence, z(k + rM ), to k = 0,

advantageous in that its cross-correlation is all-zero, the DFT

SEQUENCES

In [13], a new construction of ZCZ sequence set was introduced by Torii, Nakamura and Suehiro (TNS), based on perfect sequences and unitary matrices. Here, we brieﬂy compare
the main features of the TNS construction and the construction
A (Table 1). This comparison is appropriate, in that both TNS
sequences and construction A are closely related to chirp-like
sequences, or bat chirps [3], and in that the two constructions
have suitably matching dimensions.
The TNS construction utilizes smaller number of phases
than construction A, which is desirable in some navigation
and communications applications but might be a disadvantage
in radar and cryptography. The main advantage of the TNS
construction is that its |ZACZ| reaches the theoretical upper
