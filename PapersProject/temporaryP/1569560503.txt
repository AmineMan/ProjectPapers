Abstract—For information transmission a discrete time channel with independent additive Gaussian noise is used. There
is also feedback channel with independent additive Gaussian
noise, and the transmitter observes without delay all outputs
of the forward channel via that feedback channel. Transmission
of nonexponential number of messages is considered and the
achievable decoding error exponent for such a combination of
channels is investigated. It is shown that for any ﬁnite noise in
the feedback channel the achievable error exponent is better than
similar error exponent of the no-feedback channel. Method of
transmission/decoding used in the paper strengthens the earlier
method used by authors for BSC. In particular, for small
feedback noise, it allows to get the gain up to 23.6% (instead
of 14.3% earlier for BSC).

random variables, i.e. Eξi = 0, Eξi = 1. It is also assumed

where η = (η1 , . . . , ηn ) are independent (and independent of

ξ) N (0, 1)–Gaussian random variables, i.e. Eηi = 0, Eηi =
1, and the value σ = 0 is given. No coding is used in
the feedback channel (i.e. the receiver simply re-transmits
all received outputs to the transmitter). In other words, the
feedback channel is “passive” (see Fig. 1).
We assume that the input x satisﬁes the following constraint
n

x2 ≤ nA,
i

Channel model

where A is a given constant. For short, we denote by
AWGN(A) the channel (1) with constraint (3) without feedback, and by AWGN(A, σ) that channel with noisy feedback
(2).
Since Shannon’s paper [1] it has been known that even
noiseless feedback does not increase the capacity of the
Gaussian (or any other memoryless) channel. However, feedback can improve the decoding error probability (or simplify
effective transmission methods). In the case of noiseless feedback possibility of such improvement of the decoding error
probability with respect to no-feedback channel was shown
for a number of channels in [3]–[10].
In case of noisy feedback possibility of such improvement
with respect to no-feedback channel was ﬁrst shown in [11],
[12] (for binary symmetric channel). The purpose of this paper
is to get similar (in fact, much stronger) results for Gaussian
channel.
We consider the case when the overall transmission time
n and M = eo(n) equiprobable messages {θ1 , . . . , θM } are
ˆ
given. After the moment n, the receiver makes a decision θ on
the message transmitted. We are interested in the best possible
decoding error exponent (and whether it can exceed similar
exponent of the channel without feedback).
Such case of nonexponential (on n) number M (i.e. R = 0)
was investigated in [11], [12] (for BSC channel). Later in [13],
[14] those results were generalized to positive rates R.
Some related results or topics for channels with noiseless
feedback can be found in [2–12], and for the case of noisy
feedback – in [15], [16] (see also discussion in [12]).

We consider the discrete time channel with independent
additive Gaussian noise, i.e. if x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) is the input
codeword then the received block y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) is
i = 1, . . . , n,

In the paper we consider the case when (ln Mn )/n → 0 as
n → ∞ (it corresponds to zero-rate of transmission).
It is known [2] (it corresponds to a simplex code)

For comparison with the paper results we remind results obtained earlier in [11]–[14]. There the direct and feedback channels were BSC(p) and BSC(p1 ), respectively. It was shown in
[11]–[14] that there exists a critical value pcrit (p, R) > 0 such
that if p1 < pcrit (p, R) then it is possible to improve decoding
error exponent of the no-feedback channel. If, in particular,
both R and p1 are small then gain is 14.3%. In order to get
such improvement the transmission/decoding method with one
“switching” moment was developed and investigated.
The method of [11], [12] was applied to Gaussian channel
AWGN(A, σ) in [18] with similar to [11], [12] results (in
particular, with the same asymptotic gain of 14.3%).
Remark 1: The transmission method used in [11]–[14] reduces the problem to testing of two most probable (at some
ﬁxed moment) messages. It was mentioned in [12, Remark 1]
and [14, Remark 3] that such method is not optimal even for
one switching moment.
In the paper, still using one “switching” moment, we
essentially improve the transmission/decoding method from
[11]–[14]. We show that for any feedback noise intensity
σ 2 < ∞ it is possible to improve the best error exponent
of the AWGN(A) channel without feedback. The transmission/decoding method with one “switching” moment, giving
such improvement, is described in Section II. It strengthens the
method introduced by authors earlier in [11]–[14]. Of course,
if σ is not small then the improvement is small (but strictly
positive).
Remark 2: We consider the case when feedback noise intensity σ > 0 is ﬁxed and does not depend on the number
of messages M . The case when σ is such that σ 2 M is small
represents, in a sense, the noiseless feedback case (cf. [18]).

In other words, for large (but nonexponential) M noiseless
feedback gives 100% of error exponent improvement over
similar error exponent of the no-feedback Gaussian channel.
For AWGN(A, σ) channel denote by F1 (M, A, σ) the error
exponent for the transmission method with one switching
moment, described in Section II. Clearly, F1 (M, A, σ) ≤
F (M, A, σ) for all M, A, σ.
In order to avoid bulky general formulations we present
results only in two extreme cases: small σ and large σ. Our
main results are as follows.
Theorem. Let ln M = o(n), n → ∞. Then:
a) If σ → 0 then the formula holds

Since 1/(2 + 5) ≈ 0.236, then for large M formula (6)
gives 23.6% of improvement with respect to the no-feedback
channel.

length n.
For a code C = {xi } denote by Pe (C) the minimal possible
decoding error probability

F1 (M, A, σ) ≥

Pe (C) = min max P (e|xi ),

(7)

In other words, for any non-exponential Mn and any σ < ∞
we get an improvement of the no-feedback error exponent.
Remark 3: Using the transmission strategy with one ﬁxed
switching moment, it is possible to get better gain than in
(6) (elaborating more intensively dependence among random
variables involved). But computations become too much bulky.
Much more interesting would be to investigate transmission
strategies with several (or increasing) number of switching
moments.

If M = Mn is the number of messages, then for AWGN(A)
channel denote by Pe (M, A, n) the minimal possible decoding
error probability for the best (M, A, n)–code. Introduce the
exponent (in n) of that function

II. T RANSMISSION / DECODING METHOD
We use the transmission strategy with one ﬁxed switching
moment at which the coding function will be changed. The
transmission method used earlier in [11]–[14], (and in [18])
reduces the problem to testing of two most probable (at some
ﬁxed moment) messages. We improve that strategy in both
transmission and decoding stages.

Similarly, for AWGN(A, σ) channel let Pe (M, A, σ, n) be
the minimal possible decoding error probability for the best
transmission method. Introduce the function

For simplicity, we consider the case M ≤ (n + 2)/2. We
partition the total transmission time [1, n] on two phases:
[1, M − 1] (phase I) and [M, 2M − 2] (phase II). Thus the
total length of the code used is 2M − 2. The remaining time
[2M − 1, n] is not used. After moment 2M − 2 the receiver
makes a decision in favor of the most probable message θi
(based on all received on [1, 2M − 2] signals).
Each of M codewords {xi } of length 2M − 2 have the
form xi = (xi , xi ), where xi has length M − 1 (to be used
on phase I) and xi also has length M − 1 (to be used on
phase II). Similarly, the received block y can be represented
as y = (y , y ), where y is the block received on phase I
and y is the block received on phase II. Denote by z the
received (by the transmitter) block on phase I. The codewords
ﬁrst parts {xi } are ﬁxed, while the second parts {xi } will
depend on the block z received by the transmitter on phase
I.
We set two positive constants A1 , A2 such that
A1 + A2 = nA,
and denote
β=

A2
,
A1

A3 =

then on phase II the transmitter uses the same simplex
code of M codewords {xi } of length M − 1.
Case 2: If after phase I
d(3)t − d(2)t = τ A3 > τ0 A3 ,

then on phase II the transmitter uses another code {xk }:
a) two most probable messages θi , θj have opposite
codewords xi = −xj of length M − 1 which have nonzero coordinates only at moment M − 2;
b) remaining M − 2 messages {θk } use a simplex code
of M −2 codewords {xk } of length M −3 trailed by two
0’s at moments M −2, M −1. All those M −2 codewords
{xk } are orthogonal to the ﬁrst two codewords (xi , xj ).
This transmission method generalizes the method used in
[14]. The code used in case I resolves the case when after
(1)t
(2)t
(3)t
phase I three most probable codewords x
,x
,x
are
approximately equiprobable.
Remark 4: The assumption M ≤ (n + 2)/2 was used only
to simplify description of the codes (simplex) used on phases I
and II. In fact, all results remain valid if for a code C on phase
I we have mini=j xi − xj 2 ≥ 2A1 (1 + o(1)) as n → ∞
(and similarly for phase II). That condition can be fulﬁlled if
M = eo(n) .

Decoding. Due to noise in the feedback channel the re(3)t

ceiver does not know exactly codewords x
and the value τ , and therefore it does not know the code
used on phase II. But based on the received block y , the
receiver may evaluate the conditional probabilities of code(3)t
(2)t
(1)t
and of the value τ , and so get the
,x

probabilities with which each code was used.
As a result, based on whole received block y, the receiver
uses maximum likelihood decoding, evaluating posterior probabilities {p(y|xi )} and making decision in favor of most
probable message θi . Such full decoding is described below.

Then A = (1 + β)A1 /n.
Arrange the distances {d(xi , y ) = y − xi 2 , i =

Transmission. On phase I the transmitter uses a simplex
code of M codewords {xi } of length M −1 such that xi 2 =

The receiver makes decision after moment n using whole
received block y. If after phase I the difference d(3) − d(2) is
rather close to τ0 A3 (see (10) and (11)) then due to noise in
the feedback link the receiver cannot be sure which code was
