of the coarse lattice Λe and a random point inside this coset
is transmitted.
In [5] the existence of lattice codes (based on the ensemble
of random lattice codes) achieving the secrecy capacity under
the weak secrecy criterion was demonstrated. Explicit wiretap
lattice codes from an error probability point of view were
proposed in [6], which also introduced the notion of secrecy
gain and showed that Eve’s correct decoding probability
limn→∞ Pc = 0 for even unimodular lattices.
In this paper we prove that lattice codes can achieve
strong secrecy if both Bob and Eve’s channels are mod-Λ
Gaussian channels. We follow Csisz´ r’s idea [2] to show that
a
the conditional output distributions corresponding to different
messages converge to the same distribution in the sense of L1
distance or variational distance. As shown in [7], this can be
done by choosing a binning scheme such that the bin rate is
above the capacity of the eavesdropper’s channel. We propose
the ﬂatness factor as a fundamental new parameter to prove L1
convergence of conditional outputs and to assess the goodness
of lattice codes for secrecy. We note that we do not require
the message M to be uniformly distributed, which implies that
the proposed code features semantic security.
The analysis of the mod-Λ channel was a key element in
the proof that lattice coding and decoding achieve the capacity
of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in
[8, 9]. The mod-Λ wiretap channel was already considered
in [10] in the context of secrecy with noisy feedback, where
it was suggested that ﬁnding good wiretap codes for this
model can give signiﬁcant insight to solve the AWGN case.
However, as observed in [10], transferring these techniques
from the modulo-Λ case to the AWGN case is not trivial since
the modulo structure helps to conceal information from the
eavesdropper.

Abstract—We consider a wiretap scenario where the main
channel and eavesdropper’s channel are modulo lattice Gaussian
channels. We prove that nested lattice codes can achieve strong
secrecy for this model, which gives considerable insights to tackle
the genuine Gaussian wiretap channel. The key tool in our
proof is an L1 convergence result for the conditional output
distributions corresponding to different messages, which follows
from the properties of the lattice Gaussian measure. No constraint
on the a priori distribution of the message is imposed, which
means that the proposed scheme is actually semantically secure.
We not only show the existence of lattice codes that are good for
secrecy, but also propose the ﬂatness factor as a design criterion.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The idea of information-theoretic security stems from Shannon’s notion of perfect secrecy. Perfect security can be
achieved by encoding an information message M into a codeword Z in such a way that the mutual information I(M; Z) = 0.
However, perfect security is impractical because it requires a
one-time pad.
In the context of noisy channels, Wyner [1] proved that
both robustness to transmission errors and a prescribed degree of data conﬁdentiality could simultaneously be attained
by channel coding without any secret key. Wyner replaced
Shannon’s perfect secrecy with the weak secrecy condition
1
limn→∞ n I(M; Zn ) = 0, namely the asymptotic rate of leaked
information between the message M and the channel output
Zn should vanish as the block length n tends to inﬁnity.
Unfortunately, it is still possible for a scheme satisfying
weak secrecy to exhibit some security ﬂaws, e.g., the total
amount of leaked information may go to inﬁnity, and now
it is widely accepted that a physical-layer security scheme
should be secure in the sense of Csisz´ r’s strong secrecy
a
limn→∞ I(M; Z) = 0 [2].
Explicit wiretap codes achieving strong secrecy over discrete memoryless channels have been proposed in [3, 4].
For continuous channels such as the Gaussian channel, the
problem of achieving strong secrecy is still open. Recently,
some progress has been made in using nested lattice codes
over Gaussian wiretap channels. It is quite natural to replace
Wyner’s random binning with coset coding induced by a lattice
partition Λe ⊂ Λb . The secret bits are used to select one coset

II. G AUSSIAN MEASURES ON LATTICES
The lattice Gaussian measure arises in a number of problems
in coding [8] and cryptography [11]. Let σ > 0, λ and x be
any vectors in Rn and Λ an n-dimensional lattice in Rn . We
deﬁne the Gaussian distribution of variance σ centered at λ as
∥x−λ∥2

e− 2σ2 .

A. Flatness factor

λ∗ ∈Λ∗

Deﬁnition 1 (Flatness factor). The ﬂatness factor of the
Gaussian measure is deﬁned as the maximum ratio fσ,Λ (x)
can deviate from the uniform distribution on the fundamental
region R(Λ) of Λ:
ϵΛ (σ)

maxx∈R(Λ) |fσ,Λ (x) − Ex [fσ,Λ (x)]|
.
Ex [fσ,Λ (x)]

In other words, fσ,Λ (x) is within 1±ϵΛ (σ) from the uniform
distribution. Note that this deﬁnition is slightly different from
that in [12]. The difference is that this deﬁnition also accounts
for the minimum of fσ,Λ (x).

We introduce the notion of variational distance or statistical
distance between two distributions:
Deﬁnition 3 (Variational distance). Let p and q be two discrete
distributions on a ﬁnite set X . Then the variational distance
between p and q is
∑
V(p, q)
|p(x) − q(x)| .

where γ = V2πσ2 is the generalized signal-to-noise ratio

Proof: Obviously, Ex [fσ,Λ (x)] = 1/V (Λ). Using the
Fourier expansion of fσ,Λ (x) [8, 11], we have

Similarly, for continuous distributions with densities p and q,
the variational distance is deﬁned by
∫
V(p, q)
|p(x) − q(x)| dx = ∥p − q∥L1 .

The ﬂatness factor also gives a bound on the variational
distance between the Gaussian distribution reduced mod R(Λ)
and the uniform distribution UR(Λ) on R(Λ). This result was
already proven in [11] using the smoothing parameter when
R(Λ) is the fundamental parallelotope.

In spite of the equivalence, the advantage of the ﬂatness
factor is two-fold:
• It gives a precise characterization ϵ by the theta series.
Note that it is ϵ, not the smoothing parameter, that is of
interest to communications.
• The smoothing parameter is mostly concerned with small
values of ϵ, while the ﬂatness factor can handle both
large and small values of ϵ. The latter is of interest in
communication applications [12].

Proposition 3. For c ∈ Rn let Y (x) = [fσ,c (x)] mod R(Λ).
Then

Proof: Observe that restricting the Gaussian measure to
any fundamental region of Λ is equivalent to considering the
Gaussian distribution mod R(Λ):
∑
[fσ,c (x)] mod R(Λ) =
fσ,c (x − λ)1R(Λ) (x) =

where the equality in (a) holds if x ∈ Λ so that ⟨λ∗ , x⟩ is an
integer, (b) is due to the Poisson sum formula, and (c) follows
from the deﬁnition of the theta series.
Remark 1. The equality in (a) implies that the maxima of both
fσ,Λ (x) and |fσ,Λ (x) − Ex [fσ,Λ (x)]| are reached if x ∈ Λ.

III. A N U PPER B OUND ON M UTUAL I NFORMATION
In what follows we will consider both continuous and
discrete random variables as well as mixed pairs of discrete
and continuous random variables. Let X, Y be continuous
random variables taking values in Rn with densities pX and
pY respectively, and M, M′ discrete random variables taking
values in a ﬁnite set Mn with probability mass functions
pM , pM′ . Let pXM (x, m) be the joint hybrid density of the
mixed pair (X, M): that is, ∀m ∈ Mn , pXM (·, m) is the density
corresponding to the probability measure µm (A) = P{M =
m, X ∈ A} for all measurable sets A ⊆ Rn .

pX , pY is D(pX ∥pY ) = Rn pX (x) log pY (x) dx. Similarly,
(x)
∑
pM (m)
D(pM ∥pM′ ) =
m∈M pM (m) log pM′ (m) . It is well known
that the mutual information I(X; Y) = D(pXY ∥pX pY ).
The following Lemma is a continuous version of Lemma 1
in [2]. The proof is similar to the discrete case and will be
given in the full version of this paper.

Consider a message set Mn = {1, . . . , 2nR }, and a oneto-one function f : Mn → [Λb /Λe ] which associates each
message m ∈ Mn to a coset leader λm ∈ Λb ∩ V(Λe ). Note
that we make no a priori assumption on the distribution of M.
In order to encode the message m, Alice selects a random
lattice point λ ∈ Λe ∩ V(Λs ) according to the discrete uniform
1
distribution pL (λ) = 2nR′ and transmits Xn = λ + λm . For
λi ∈ [Λs /Λe ], deﬁne
Ri (Λe ) = (V(Λe ) + λi ) mod Λs =
∑
=
(V(Λe ) + λi + λs ) ∩ V(Λs ).
λs ∈Λs

The Ri (Λe ) are fundamental regions of Λe and
∪
Ri (Λe ) = V(Λs ).

Lemma 1. Let X and Z be continuous random variables
deﬁned on Rn with distributions pX and pZ . Let f : Rn →
{1, 2, . . . , k} be any mapping, and let M = f (X). If k ≥ 4,
then
k
I(M; Z) ≤ dav (f ) log
,
dav (f )
∑k
where dav (f ) = m=1 pM (m)V(pZ|M =m , pZ ).

We now apply the continuous version of Csisz` r’s Lemma to
a
derive an upper bound on the amount of leaked information
on the mod-Λs wiretap channel (4). Note that even though we
consider a mod-Λs channel, the secrecy condition is given in
terms of the ﬂatness factor of the lattice Λe .

Note that Lemma 2 in [2] also holds: for any distribution
qZ on Rn ,

Theorem 1. Suppose that the ﬂatness factor of Λe is ϵΛe (σe )
on the eavesdropper’s channel. Then

Lemma 2. Suppose that the number of bins is |Mn | = k =
2nR and that ∀n there exists some density un over Rn such
that V(pZn |M=m , un ) ≤ εn , ∀m ∈ {1, . . . , 2nR }. Then dav ≤
2εn and so
I(M; Z ) ≤ 2εn nR − 2εn log 2εn .

V. C ONCLUDING REMARKS
Yi (z),

We close this paper with some remarks.
Relation to secrecy gain: A small ﬂatness factor requires a
small theta series, which coincides with the criterion of secrecy
gain: a large secrecy gain requires a small theta series [6].
Relation to resolvability: In [7, 13] (see also the earlier works [14, 15]) a technique based on resolvability was
suggested to obtain strong secrecy, which uses a binning
scheme such that the bin rate is above the capacity of the
eavesdropper’s channel. We will show this is also the case for
the proposed lattice scheme.
If the bin rate R′ is large enough, we can approximate the
average power P in (5) with the second moment per dimension
σ 2 (Λs ) (continuous approximation [16], which could be made
rigorous by adding a dither [9]):

Recalling the deﬁnition of dav in Lemma 1, and deﬁning
qZ (z) = UV(Λe ) (z), from the inequality (2) we ﬁnd that
dav ≤ 2ϵΛ(n) (σe ). Then the mutual information can be
e
estimated using Lemma 2.
From Theorem 1, we obtain a sufﬁcient condition for a
sequence of nested lattice wiretap codes to achieve strong
secrecy:

Now choose Λs which is good for quantization.

so C(Λs , σe ) → 1 log 2πeP − 1 log 2πeσe = 1 log SNRe .

Relation to Poltyrev’s setting of inﬁnite constellations:
Poltyrev initiated the study of inﬁnite constellations in the
presence of Gaussian noise [17]. In this setting, although
the standard channel capacity is meaningless (so he deﬁned
generalized capacity), the secrecy capacity is ﬁnite. This is
because the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel
σ2
as P → ∞ converges to a ﬁnite rate 1 log( σe ). Lattice
2
2
b
codes can not be better than this, so it is an upper bound.
Even though we considered a mod-Λs channel in this paper,
we may enlarge V(Λs ) (i.e., increase R′ while ﬁxing R) to
approach an inﬁnite constellation. It is easy to check that,
given R, the upper bound on the mutual information of our
proposed scheme is independent of V (Λs ), and thus the limit
exists as V (Λs ) → ∞. This corresponds to the case of
inﬁnite constellations. Further, the achieved secrecy rate is
only 1 log2 e away from the upper bound.

Relation to the genuine AWGN channel: We expect that the
technique developed in this paper can be extended to solve
Pe

as long as the generalized SNR γ < 1.
Proof: Our new averaging bound for the theta series
(see the Appendix) guarantees the existence of a sequence of
lattices Λ(n) such that ΘΛ (y) ≤ 1+ 1 n . For this sequence,
V (Λ)y 2
Proposition 1 gives

Therefore, if Eve’s generalized SNR γe is smaller than 1,
then strong secrecy can be achieved by lattice codes, and in
fact the mutual information will vanish exponentially.
So far we have proven the existence of good lattice codes
for strong secrecy. The ﬂatness factor actually tells more than
that. From a practical perspective, we have a design criterion:
Corollary 2 (Design criterion of good lattice codes for secrecy). A lattice Λe is good for secrecy if its ﬂatness factor
ϵΛe is small.
To prove the reliability for Bob, we need a ﬁne lattice Λb
which is good for channel coding. We use a sphere-bound
achieving lattice deﬁned by Forney [8], whose error probability
tends to zero as long as γb > e. It is easy to see that we may
obtain any secrecy rate

A PPENDIX
AVERAGING BEHAVIOR OF THETA SERIES
In [18], Loeliger derived a version of the MinkowskiHlawka theorem based on the averaging over ConstructionA lattices. We will adapt his method to derive the average
behavior of the theta series for Construction A. Loeliger’s
derivation has a limitation in that it requires a function of
bounded support, which is not the case for the Gaussian
function associated with the theta series. This limitation will
be circumvented here.
For integer p > 0, let Zn → Zn : v → v be the elementp
wise reduction modulo-p. Following [18], consider mod-p lattices (Construction A) of the form ΛC {v ∈ Zn : v ∈ C},
where p is a prime and C is a linear code over Zp . In the
proof, scaled mod-p lattices αΛC {αv : v ∈ ΛC } for some
α ∈ R are used. The fundamental volume of such a lattice is
V (αΛC ) = αn pn−k , where n and k are the block length and
dimension of the code C, respectively. A set C of linear codes
over Zp is said to be balanced if every nonzero element of Zp
is contained in the same number of codes from C. In particular,
the set of all linear (n, k) codes over Zp is balanced.

Lemma 3 (Average behavior of theta series). Let C be any
balanced set of linear (n, k) codes over Zp . Then, for 0 <
k < n and for αn pn−k = V ﬁxed,

Proof: Let f (v) = e−πy∥v∥ for v ∈ Rn and ﬁxed y ∈
R , and denote by C ′ the set of all nonzero codewords of C.
Following [18], we have
