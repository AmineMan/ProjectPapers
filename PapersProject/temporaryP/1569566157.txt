lower detection complexity, but in general at the expense of a
signiﬁcantly reduced bit rate. Considerable effort has been put
in reducing the decoding complexity of non-orthogonal STCs.
For example, the complexity of decoding squared 2 × 2 STCs
for the 2×2 MIMO channel was said to be reduced to O(M 2.5 )
[14], [16]. However, the achieved complexity reductions are
not valid for all STCs and all MIMO channels.
We add a new dimension to the quest for low-complexity
STCs, by reducing the dimension of the STC itself, without
compromising on rate or diversity. In the context of coded
communication, i.e., assuming an error-correcting code with
coding rate Rc < 1, we prove that the outage probability1
of an n × r MIMO channel with r ≥ n, can have full
transmit diversity using time-varying n × 1 (i.e. space-only)
STCs, limiting its dimension by a factor of n with respect to
optimal STCs. Time-varying rotations were ﬁrst used by [21],
where the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff has been analysed for
Gaussian alphabets in a multihop scenario. This paper extends
[5], where full diversity of this new class of STCs was proved
for 2×2 MIMO channels. This work has been extended in [6],
also including the case where r < n, including more detailed
proofs and more numerical results.

Abstract—Multiple antennas are used to increase reliability
and bit rate for a given bandwidth. For a ﬁxed transmission
rate, discrete input alphabets and no channel state information
at the transmitter, optimal space-time codes (STCs) achieving
both gains (full rate and full diversity) are well known. However, the complexity of maximum likelihood decoding increases
exponentially with the number of space and time dimensions of
the STC. Despite praiseworthy efforts to reduce the decoding
complexity, optimal STCs are not used in practice in the case of
more than two transmit antennas because of complexity reasons.
It is generally accepted that reducing the dimension of the STC
leads to a reduced diversity order. We show that this is not
true for coded communication, assuming the presence of an
outer error-correcting code with any coding rate. We propose a
new class of full-rate full-diversity STCs; more speciﬁcally, timevarying space-only codes. This new class is referred to as EMI
codes. Full diversity is proven in terms of outage probability, for
the case where the number of receive antennas is larger than or
equal to the number of transmit antennas, and is numerically
veriﬁed in terms of outage and word error probability using
LDPC codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Channels with multiple antenna at in- and output (MIMO)
have more degrees of freedom which can be used to increase
spectral efﬁciency (through spatial multiplexing) and reliability (through diversity). We consider classical Rayleigh faded
n × r MIMO channels, where n and r are the number of
transmit and receive antennas, respectively. The maximum
spectral efﬁciency under which the maximal diversity order
rn is achievable is min(n, r) log2 M , where M is the constellation size, achieving a multiplexing gain of min(n, r).
When the spectral efﬁciency is taken constant, both diversity
and multiplexing gains can be fully achieved simultaneously,
through full-rate full-diversity space-time codes (STCs). STCs
for uncoded communication, i.e., without outer code, have
been designed by minimizing the pairwise error probability
under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding (e.g. [1], [12], [15],
[18]). For coded communication, STCs have been designed
assuming a genie (e.g. [11]). An STC taking into account both
criteria was proposed in [4].
In the worst case, without sphere decoding [20], the complexity of exhaustive ML decoding of a u×v STC (coding over
u space dimensions and v time dimensions) at the receiver
scales as O(M uv ). Therefore, optimal n × n STCs may
be too complex to decode, e.g. scaling as O(1616 ) when
16−QAM and n = 4. Orthogonal STCs [18] have a much

MODEL

We consider a point-to-point MIMO channel H = [hi,j ] ∈
Cr×n with n transmit antennas and r receive antennas, where
hi,j ∼ CN (0, 1) is the complex path gain from transmit
antenna j to receive antenna i. We assume that all path gains
are independent. The channel state information is perfectly
known at the receiver side, but unknown at the transmitter
side. The channel is assumed to vary slowly, so that it remains
constant during the transmission of at least one codeword.
Assuming a total of Nc channel uses per codeword, the output
of the matched ﬁlter at the destination is
√
µt = γ Hζ t + ν t , t = 1, . . . , Nc ,

1 The outage probability is a fundamental and achievable lower bound on
the average word error rate (WER) of coded systems [2].

additive white Gaussian noise vector ν t has i.i.d. entries,
νi,t ∼ CN (0, 1). The transmit vector ζ t belongs to Ωζ and
its components ζj,t satisfy E[|ζj,t |2 ] = 1, ∀ j, t. The overall

N0 , so that N0 = γ =
nr
is the spectral efﬁciency and Rc is the coding rate. The
instantaneous mutual information I(ζ t ; µt |H) depends on Ωζ
and the channel realization H.
The channel realization H can be decomposed by a singular
value decomposition (SVD) as H = U ΣV † , where U ∈ Cr×r
and V ∈ Cn×n are unitary matrices, uniformly distributed in
the Stiefel manifold with respect to the Haar measure [13, Sec.
2.1.4] [7, Sec. 3.2], V † is the Hermitian transpose of V , and
Σ ∈ Rr×n is a diagonal matrix with the non-negative singular
values σi , i = 1, . . . , min(r, n) of H on its diagonal. Because
H is known at the receiver, the following transformation can
be performed,
√
yt = U † µt = γ ΣV † ζ t + wt , t = 1, . . . , Nc (2)

are n × n full-rate full-diversity STCs (hence k = n). The
precoder Pl = P is constant, has dimension n2 and its
elements are optimized to maximize the coding gain (see for
example [1], [4], [11], [12], [15], [18]). As mentioned before,
their detection is complex for increasing n.
We propose time-varying space-only STCs, hence k = 1 so
that Pl only has dimension n, but Pl varies with l. Because
the STC is space-only, the notation simpliﬁes: ζ t = Pt zt ,
t = 1, . . . , Nc , where zt,i ∈ Ωz , i = 1, . . . , n. We consider
the Cartesian product of n constellations Ωz = (Ωz )n , so
that zt ∈ Ωz . We denote our new precoder type by the EMI
code, where EMI (Ergodic Mutual Information) refers to the
temporal mean of the mutual information.

where wt follows the same distribution as ν t . Because U † µt
is an invertible transformation, no information is lost, i.e.,
I(ζ t ; yt |Σ, V ) = I(ζ t ; µt |H). The outage probability is
expressed as

where xt = V † Pt zt = Vt zt (this can model both our proposed
time-varying space-only precoder Pt as a ﬁxed space-only
precoder Pt = P ). Hence, Σ corresponds to the parallel
channel, Vt corresponds to the precoder and zt corresponds
to the symbol vector that is transformed by the precoder. The
parallel channel model with precoding is well known for the
study of signal space diversity (SSD) (see [3] for uncoded and
[9] for coded communication over parallel channels), where
Vt is a rotation matrix. In SSD, full transmit diversity is
achieved when Vt is chosen so that st,i = 0, ∀ i, t, where
st = x′ − xt , x′ , xt ∈ Ωx , x′ = xt .

If Vt is a bad precoder, full diversity is not achieved.
Deﬁnition 1: We deﬁne bad precoders Pbad as the set of
precoders so that ∃ i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, xt , x′ t = xt , satisfying
xt,i = x′ or equivalently, st,i = 0.
t,i
The main difference with the parallel channel with precoding is that the considered precoder Vt is random for MIMO.
At ﬁrst, consider a unitary but ﬁxed precoder Pt = P , so
that Vt has the same distribution as V , hence Vt is uniformly
distributed in the Stiefel manifold with respect to the Haar
measure. Because Vt is ﬁxed, we drop all time indices t and
denote V ′ = Vt . As the precoder does not change the channel
distribution, seen by the symbol vector z, it is well known
that a ﬁxed space-only precoder does not achieve transmit
diversity. However, from the parallel channel point of view,
this may not seem obvious, as the probability of having
bad precoders, V ′ ∈ Pbad , is zero. In accordance with the
terminology of parallel channels with precoding, we explain
the loss of transmit diversity by deﬁning corrupt precoders.
Deﬁnition 2: We deﬁne corrupt precoders Pc as the set of
precoders so that ∃ z, z′ = z, satisfying |si | ≤ γ −0.5 , ∀ i > 1.
Lemma 1: The probability that a random precoder falls in
the set of corrupt precoders is

Pout = Pr(Et [I(ζ t ; yt |Σ, V )] < R),

III. L INK

The channel Eq. (2) is very similar to that of a parallel
channel with precoding. We denote xt = V † ζ t , where xt ∈
Ωx , hence I(xt ; yt |Σ, V ) = I(ζ t ; y t |H). Inserting xt in Eq.
(2), we have that

diversity order, is

In the case that r > n, then the last r − n received symbols
in yt contain only noise due to the fact that the bottom r − n
rows of Σ are zero (see Eq. (2)). Hence, when we consider
r > n in the following, then, allowing an abuse in notation,
yt , wt and Σ refer to the top n rows of the actual vectors
yt , wt and Σ, respectively. As a result, a new n × n MIMO
channel is obtained, with a different singular value distribution
than that from a normal n × n channel. Therefore, we only
consider n × n channels in the following (using the notation
from Eq. (2)), but we use the actual singular value distribution.
An n × k STC (containing nk elements) contains k vectors

where the components of zl belong to an M -QAM constellation Ωz , i.e., zl,i ∈ Ωz , i = 1, . . . , nk. We denote

RATE AND FULL DIVERSITY SPACE - ONLY CODES

We propose to marginalize the effect of corrupt precoders
by averaging the mutual information over all unitary precoders
Vt during the transmission of a codeword. Therefore, we let
Pt be uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold. Since
V is unitary and independent of Pt and the distribution of
Pt is invariant to unitary transformation, Vt = V † Pt is also
uniformly distributed in the Stiefel manifold.
Proposition 1: In a point-to-point n × r MIMO ﬂat fading
channel, using a coding rate Rc < 1 and using n×n precoders
Pt , randomly generated for each channel use, being uniformly
distributed in the Stiefel manifold, full diversity is achieved.
Proof: Similarly to Pc , we deﬁne a larger set Sc , which is
the set of precoders Vt so that ∃ i, z, z′ = z, satisfying |si |2 ≤
(log γ)−p , for any p > 0. The probability Pr(Vt ∈ Sc ) → 0
for large γ (see App. B). Denoting I(xt ; yt |Σ, Vt ) as I(Vt ),
we can write Et [I(Vt )] as

The inﬁnum is (r − n + 1)(1 + ǫ), which is achieved when
αn = . . . = α2 = 0 and α1 = 1 + ǫ. This holds for each
ǫ > 0, and the bound in Eq. (12) can be made tight taking the
inﬁnum inf ǫ dout (ǫ) (see e.g. [9]), we obtain dout ≤ r.
In accordance with the terminology of parallel channels with
precoding, the loss of transmit diversity is caused because the
random precoder falls too often in the set of corrupt precoders,
or more precisely, because the speed at which the probability
to have a corrupt precoder goes to zero is too slow.

We assume an n × n MIMO channel, where n = 2 (Fig. 1)
and n = 3 (Fig. 2). In the legend of the Figs., “Out” refers
to outage, and the other curves refer to the practical WER
performance. In all cases, the loss of the EMI code to the
optimal STCs is more or less 1.5 dB in terms of the outage
probability. The EMI-10 code performs 0.5 dB worse than the
EMI code. The WERs of the LDPC codes suggest that the
results with respect to the outage probabilities are maintained
when using a practical error-correcting code.
Note that the focus of this paper was on diversity and rate.

Through a lossless transformation at the receiver, the MIMO
channel is converted into a parallel channel with a random
precoder V that depends on the channel realization. The
new channel has an identical mutual information. Using this
new channel model, we study the fundamental reason why
full diversity is not achieved without space-time coding. A
set of corrupt precoders, with a non-negligible probability
of occurrence, causes the loss in transmit diversity order.
Therefore, we propose a new full-diversity full-rate spaceonly code which we refer to as the EMI code. The latter
averages the mutual information of the MIMO channel over all
random precoders V , thereby marginalizing corrupt precoders.
We prove that the new precoder achieves full diversity if an
error-correcting code with coding rate Rc < 1 is used. The
EMI code is said to be full rate because n new symbols
are transmitted each channel use, where n is the number of
transmit antennas. The main asset of this new coding scheme
is that its complexity of decoding is signiﬁcantly lower, as its
dimension is n instead of n2 , at the expense of a small loss
in performance. The theory is corroborated in the numerical

By letting ǫ2 → 0+ , we obtain dout = nr for any Rc < 1.
The proposed code is denoted as EMI code or EMI-T
code when Pt is randomly generated at each channel use
or only a ﬁnite number of times T during the transmission
of a codeword, respectively. The convergence properties for
increasing T are not discussed here because of the lack of
space.

RESULTS

We compare the outage probability of the proposed EMI
code with the outage probabilities of the Golden code [1]
and the perfect STC [8]. To show the practical relevance, we
include the word error rate (WER) performance of a simple
regular (3, 30) LDPC code [17] of coding rate Rc = 0.9 and
block length N = 5760, where N = mNc . In all simulation
results, Ωz = 4−QAM, so that the spectral efﬁciency is

Before we determine the probability of corrupt precoders,
we consider the following Lemma.
Lemma 3: Consider two independent random variable X
and Y which are χ2 -distributed with parameter 2a and 2b,
respectively. Then the random variable
Z=

X
∼ β(a, b)
X +Y

Proof: X ∼ Γ(a, θ = 2) ⇔ X ∼ χ2 (2a). A property
of Beta-distributions is that if X ∼ Γ(a, θ = 2) and Y ∼
X
Γ(b, θ = 2), then Z = X+Y ∼ β(a, b).
′ z−z′
Consider v = V ||z−z′ || , so that s = ||z − z′ ||v. We ﬁrst
show that v is uniform in the Stiefel manifold Sn,1 , which is
the set of all v where v† v = 1; i.e. its density is constant
for all v. Consider any v2 in Sn,1 . Consider R so that v2 =
Rv. Matrix R always exists; more speciﬁcally, R = V2 V1H ,
where V2 and V1 are unitary matrices with v2 and v on its
z−z′
ﬁrst column, respectively. Hence v2 = RV ′ ||z−z′ || , where
RV ′ is uniformly distributed in Sn,n , thus v2 has the same
distribution as v. As a consequence of the uniform distribution,
it is shown in [7, Theorem 3.1] that vt can be constructed as
g
vt =

(17)

where g ∼ CN (0, I). Hence,

Because |gi |2 ∼ χ2 (2) and i=2 |gi |2 ∼ χ2 (2(n − 1)) (up
to a constant), we have that n |vi |2 ∼ β(n − 1, 1) and
i=2
|vi |2 ∼ β(1, n − 1) by Lemma 3. Now we can determine
Pr(Pc ).
