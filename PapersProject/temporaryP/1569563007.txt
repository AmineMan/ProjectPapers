Quantization Effect On Second Moment Of
Log-Likelihood Ratio And Its Application To
Decentralized Sequential Detection

with equality if and only if Y = ϕ(X) is a sufﬁcient statistic
of X, see Theorem 4.1 of Kullback and Leibler [2]. This
is consistent with our intuition that Y = ϕ(X) is generally
less informative than the X itself. Note that the inequality
(1), which will be referred to as Kullback-Leibler’s inequality
below, deals with the expected value or ﬁrst moment of the
log-likelihood ratio.
In this paper, we extend the Kullback-Leibler inequality
(1) to investigate the quantization effects on the second or
other higher moments of the log-likelihood ratio. Our research is motivated by the decentralized sequential detection problem where there are unobservable random variables
Xk,n ; k = 1, . . . , K; n = 1, 2, . . . , and where what is actually
observed are their quantized versions Yk,n = ϕk,n (Xk,n ). In
such a problem, one wants to design appropriate quantization
functions ϕk,n ’s so as to utilize the Yk,n ’s to make the best
possible decision (under a proper criterion). Intuitively, it
is natural to choose ϕk,n to maximize the Kullback-Leibler
divergence of the quantized observations Iϕ (f1,k , f0,k ) (or
possibly Iϕ (f0,k , f1,k )) if the Xk,n ’s are independent with
density f1,k or f0,k for each k. In order to guarantee that the
corresponding statistical procedures are indeed efﬁcient, one
needs to verify that the distribution of quantized observations
Yk,n satisﬁes some standard regularity conditions, and one of
them is that the second moments of the log-likelihood ratios
have a common upper bound over a class of allowable quantization functions ϕk,n ’s, or equivalently, that the variances of
quantized observations are bounded above.
Unfortunately, it can be analytically challenging or intractable to verify the assumptions for quantized observations
Yk,n directly, even if the distributions of the unobservable
random variable Xk,n are known to belong to some simple
families of distributions, as one may have a large class of
quantization functions ϕk,n to work with when ﬁnding the
optimal one. To overcome such a difﬁculty, in this paper we
show that one could dispense with quantization and only look
at the second moment associated with the raw data Xk,n ’s
since the boundedness of the unquantized version implies
the boundedness of the quantized version regardless of the
quantization function ϕk,n . Also see Le Cam and Yang [4]
for similar approaches in other contexts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II we extend the Kullback-Leibler’s inequality (1) to

Abstract—It is well known that quantization cannot increase
the Kullback-Leibler divergence which can be thought of as the
expected value or ﬁrst moment of the log-likelihood ratio. In
this paper, we investigate the quantization effects on the second
moment of the log-likelihood ratio. It is shown that quantization
may result in an increase in the case of the second moment,
but the increase is bounded above by 2/e. The result is then
applied to decentralized sequential detection problems to provide
a simpler sufﬁcient condition for asymptotic optimality theory,
and the technique is also extended to investigate the quantization
effects on other higher-order moments of the log-likelihood ratio
and provide lower bounds on higher-order moments.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In information theory and statistics, the Kullback-Leibler
divergence is a fundamental quantity that characterizes the
difference between two probability distributions P1 and P0 of
a random variable X. Denote by f1 (x) and f0 (x) the densities
of P1 and P0 with respect to some common underlying
probability measure µ, then the Kullback-Leibler divergence
from P1 to P0 is
∫
f1 (x)
I(f1 , f0 ) = f1 (x) log
dµ(x) = E1 {Z}
f0 (x)
where Z is the log-likelihood ratio
f1 (X)
f0 (X)
and E1 means taking the expectation over the distribution P1 .
In some applications, we need to deal with the quantized
version of X that is a function of X and often is required to
belong to a ﬁnite alphabet. Denote by Y = ϕ(X) the quantized observation, and let Pϕ and fi (y; ϕ) be the probability
i
distribution and probability mass (or density) function of Y
when X is distributed according to Pi for i = 0 or 1. Then
the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the quantized observation
Y is
Iϕ (f1 , f0 ) = E1 {Zϕ }
Z = log

where Zϕ is the log-likelihood ratio of Y = ϕ(X) deﬁned by
Zϕ = log

An important property is that quantization cannot increase the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, that is,
Iϕ (f1 , f0 ) ≤ I(f1 , f0 )

Proof: Let L = eZ = f1 (X)/f0 (X) and Lϕ = eZϕ =

Combining the above inequalities yields (3), completing the
proof of our theorem.
It is useful to provide some comments to better understand
our theorem. First, the discrete version of the KullbackLeibler’s inequality (1) is the well-known log-sum inequality:
for non-negative numbers a1 , . . . , an and b1 , . . . , bn , denote
the sum of all ai ’s by a and the sum of all bi ’s by b, and then
we have
n
a ∑
ai
a log ≤
ai log
b
bi
i=1

Recall that in the proof of the Kullback-Leibler’s inequality
(1), one uses heavily the fact that the function H(t) = − log t
is convex when t > 0. Then, by Jensen’s inequality,
Zϕ

= log Lϕ = H(L−1 ) = H(E1 (L−1 |Y ))
ϕ
≤ E1 (H(L−1 )|Y ) = E1 (Z|Y ),

and the Kullback-Leibler’s inequality (1) is proved by taking
expectations under P1 on both sides.
Unfortunately, the above approach fails for the second moment case since the function H2 (t) = (− log t)2 = (log t)2 is
no longer convex (nor is it concave). Fortunately, this approach
can be salvaged by what we call the “convex domination”
approach, i.e., by ﬁnding a convex function that is larger, but
not too much larger, than H2 (t) = (log t)2 .
To do so, taking derivatives of the function H2 (t) = (log t)2
leads to

with equality if and only if ai /bi are constant. Meanwhile, the
discrete version of our result in (3) becomes that

bi
e
i=1

Note that the extra term on the right side is 2b/e instead of
2/e as we do not put any normalization conditions on a or b.
Second, a comparison of (1) and (3) shows that we have an
extra constant term 2/e for the second moment case, and thus

H2 (t) = 2 log t/t and H2 (t) = 2(1 − log t)/t2 .
it is natural to ask whether or not the term can be eliminated,
Thus H2 (t) = (log t)2 is convex on t ≤ e but is concave on i.e., whether it is always true that Vϕ (f1 , f0 ) ≤ V (f1 , f0 ).
The following counterexample provides a negative answer.

In the simplest version of decentralized quickest change
detection problems, we assume that an event occurs to the
network system at some unknown time ν, and changes the
k
probability measure of the raw data Xn from P0 (with density
k
k
k
f0 for observations Xn ) to P1 (with density f1 ). Furthermore,
we assume that the observations are independent over time and
from sensor to sensor, conditional on each hypothesis on the
possible change-time ν = 1, 2, 3, . . . or ν = ∞ (no change).
The objective is to jointly optimize the policies at the local
sensors and fusion center levels so as to detect the change as
soon as possible subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate.
A crucial challenge in decentralized quickest change detection is which kind of local quantizers should be used at each
local sensor. This is easy if one further assumes that each local
sensor uses a stationary local quantizer, as the corresponding
problem reduces to the classical centralized case and various
well-developed optimal or asymptotic optimal theories are
applicable, see for example Lorden [5], Moustakides [8], Page
[9], Pollak [10], Shiryaev [11] and [12], etc. In fact, it is
not difﬁcult to see that the optimal stationary quantizer ϕ∗
for any local sensor S k is the one that maximizes the local
k
k
Kullback-Leibler divergence Iϕ (f1 , f0 ), and it can be shown
∗
that such an optimal quantizer ϕ is a Monotone Likelihood
Ratio Quantizer (MLRQ), see, for example, Tsitsiklis [14],
Crow and Schwartz [1], Tartakovsky and Veeravalli [13].
On the other hand, the scenario becomes more complicated
if the local quantizers are allowed to be non-stationary. By
comparing with Bayes procedures, Veeravalli [16] conjectures
that the schemes based on the optimal stationary MLRQ ϕ∗
are asymptotically optimal regardless whether the quantizers
are stationary or not. While this conjecture sounds reasonable
as maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence seems to be
natural to construct optimal local quantizers, it is very challenging to prove or disprove it, partly because the regularity
conditions of the quantized observations are needed to do any
reasonable asymptotic analysis.
Some sufﬁcient conditions under which this conjecture
holds are available in the literature. By Lai [3], this conjecture
is true under the following sufﬁcient condition:

such that the likelihood ratio L0 = f0 (x0 )/f1 (x0 ) < e and
Li = f0 (xi )/f1 (xi ) > e for i = 1, . . . , n with L1 , . . . , Ln
being n distinct values. If we consider a quantization function
ϕ that maps all x1 , . . . , xn to a single point y1 but maps x0
to another point y0 , then V (f1 , f0 ) ≤ Vϕ (f1 , f0 ), since the
function H2 (t) = (log t)2 is strictly concave on t ≥ e. In
other words, unlike the case of Kullback-Leibler’s inequality
(1), a quantization indeed can increase the second moment of
the log-likelihood ratio. Fortunately, our theorem shows that
such an increase is at most 2/e.
III. D ECENTRALIZED S EQUENTIAL D ETECTION
The problem that motivated us to write the present paper
arises from decentralized sequential detection problems, see,
Veeravalli, Basar and Poor [17], and Veeravalli [13], [15]. Fig.
1 depicts a typical conﬁguration of a decentralized network
system that consists of K geographically deployed local
sensors S 1 , . . . , S K and a fusion center. At each time step
k
n = 1, 2, . . . , each local sensor S k observes a raw data Xn
k
and sends a quantized message Un to the fusion center, which
makes a ﬁnal decision when stopping taking observations. Due
to constraints on communication bandwidths or requirements
of reliability, the local sensors are required to compress the
k
raw data to quantized sensor messages Un ’s, which all belong
k
to ﬁnite alphabets, say {0, 1, . . . , l − 1} respectively. In
other words, the fusion center has no direct access to the
raw observations and has to make its decisions based on the
quantized sensor messages. If necessary, the fusion center can
k
send feedback, Vn , to the local sensors to adaptively adjust
the local quantization so as to achieve maximum efﬁciency.
There are many possible useful setups for the decentralized
network system, and one widely used setup is the system
with limited local memory and full feedback, or Case E in
Veeravalli, Basar and Poor [17]. Mathematically, in such a
system, the quantized sensor message sent from the local
sensor S k to the fusion center at time n is

Denote them by ϕk
opt,0 and ϕopt,1 respectively. To develop
a simple but asymptotically optimal decentralized sequential
tests, Mei [7] introduces the concept of “tandem quantizers”
where the test procedure is divided into two stages. In the
ﬁrst stage, any reasonable stationary quantizer is used and the
network system makes a preliminary decision about which of
two hypothesis is likely to be true. Then at the second stage,
each local sensor switches to one of two optimal stationary

quantizers ϕk
opt,0 or ϕopt,1 , based on the preliminary decision.
It was shown in Mei [7] that under the condition (6) together

with the symmetric condition that supϕ Vϕ (f0 , f1 ) < ∞,
the proposed two-stage tests with the tandem quantizers are
asymptotically optimal among all decentralized sequential
tests with or without stationary quantizers. By Theorem 1, the
asymptotic optimality theory in Mei [7] holds under a simpler
sufﬁcient condition: the proposed two-stage tests are asymptotically optimal as long as the distributions of raw sensor

it directly. By using Kolmogorov’s inequality for martingales,
Mei [6] provides a simpler though stronger sufﬁcient condition, and shows that the conjecture holds if there is a uniform
bound on the second moments of the log-likelihood ratios
of quantized observations. Speciﬁcally, Mei [6] showed that
condition (5) holds if for all k = 1, . . . , K,

where Vϕ is deﬁned in (2). While it was shown in [6] that relation (6) holds when the quantized messages belong to binary
sensor messages with l = 2 and when f0 and f1 belong to
the same one-parameter exponential family satisfying certain
restrictions, it is still an open problem whether condition (6)
holds in general or not, especially when the quantizers can
have arbitrary forms and belong to the inﬁnite dimensional
functional space.
To verify (6) in more general scenarios, given the inequality
in Theorem 1, it is enough to consider the second moment
associated with the raw data. To be more speciﬁc, by Theorem
1, if for all k = 1, . . . , K, for the raw observations, we have

IV. G ENERAL H IGHER - ORDER M OMENTS
The convex domination technique we developed in proving
Theorem 1 can have a broad application. In this section, it
is applied to deal with some properties of the higher-order
moments of the log-likelihood ratios.
For a positive integer j = 1, 2, . . . , deﬁne the j-th moment
of the log-likelihood ratios as
∫
(

f1 (x) )j
Wj (f1 , f0 ) = E1 (Z)j = f1 (x) log

then condition (6) holds and so does (5). Note that condition
(7) only deals with the densities of raw observations and does
not involve the stationary or non-stationary quantizers. Moreover, it is a standard assumption in the statistical literature as
a regularity condition for the raw density functions. Therefore,
condition (7) provides a simple but useful sufﬁcient condition
under which the long-standing conjecture of asymptotic optimality of the schemes with the optimal stationary MLRQ ϕ∗
is true regardless whether the quantizers are stationary or not.
Similarly, our results can also be applied to the problem
of decentralized sequential hypotheses testing, see Veeravalli,
Basar and Poor [17]. This problem is similar to the abovementioned decentralized quickest change detection problem
except that the distributions of the raw data do not change
over time. In other words, we have two simple hypotheses H0
k
and H1 regarding the distributions of Xn ’s, and conditional
k
on each of these two hypotheses, the raw observations {Xn }
form i.i.d. sequences over time n and are independent among
different sensors. The objective here is to use as few samples
as possible to correctly decide which of these two simple
hypotheses is true. An optimal sequential test is one that
balances the trade-off between the average sample size under
each hypothesis and the probabilities of making Type I and
II errors, see Veeravalli, Basar and Poor [17], Veeravalli [15]
and Mei [7] for more details.
Unlike the quickest change detection problem, nonstationary quantizers are generally needed in order to develop
asymptotically optimal decentralized sequential tests. This is
because each local sensor will have two kinds of optimal
k
k
stationary quantizers: one maximizes Iϕ (f0 , f1 ) (if H0 is true)
k
k
and the other maximizes Iϕ (f1 , f0 ) (if H1 is true), due to
the asymmetric properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergences.

where Z and Zϕ are the log-likelihood ratios of X and Y.
It turns out that we need to consider two different cases,
depending on whether j is even or odd.
When j ≥ 1 is even, it is straightforward to apply our
technique in Theorem 1. Below we will present a more general
result on the α-moments of the absolute values of the loglikelihood ratios Z and Zϕ for any real number α ≥ 1.

if 1 ≤ t < t0 , then by taking derivatives, H(t) − H(t) is a
decreasing function and thus

Note that Theorem 2 describes the quantization effects on
the j-th moment of log-likelihood ratios when the integer j ≥
1 is even, and includes Theorem 1 as a special case with α =
2. A simple calculation shows that C2 = 2/e ≈ 0.7358 and
C4 = 108/e3 ≈ 5.3770. In addition, it is interesting to see that
E1 {Zϕ } ≤ E1 {Z} (by the Kullback-Leibler’s inequality) but
E1 |Zϕ | ≤ E1 |Z| + 1 (by Theorem 2 with α = 1). Moreover,
˜
˜
it is generally not true that Wϕ,α (f1 , f0 ) ≤ Wα (f1 , f0 ), and
counterexamples can be found by exploring the fact that for
any α ≥ 1, Hα (t) = | log t|α is strictly concave when t ≥ tα .

H(t) − H(t) ≤ H(1) − H(1) = H(1) ≤ H(t∗ ) = Cj .

Thus, for all t > 0 we have 0 ≤ H(t) − H(t) ≤ Cj , and our
claim is proved.
The remaining proof of Theorem 3 can then be proceeded
along the same line as in Theorem 1 and thus omitted.
Clearly, the convex domination method we developed allows
one to deal with non-convex functions and can have broad
applications. As an illustration, it can also be used to establish
lower bound for Wj (f1 , f0 ) and Wϕ,j (f1 , f0 ) in (8) for a given
odd integer j ≥ 1. The proof is omitted due to the page limit.

Now let us focus on the case when the integer j ≥ 1 is
odd. In order to establish the relationship between Wj (f1 , f0 )
and Wϕ,j (f1 , f0 ) deﬁned in (8), it turns out that when j ≥ 1
∗
is odd, we need to deﬁne another constant Cj to be the only
real number x ≥ 0 that satisﬁes the equation
x = (j − 1)j−1 − Cj exp(−x1/j ),

Theorem 4. For an integer j ≥ 1, the j-th moments
of log-likelihood ratios, Wϕ,j (f1 , f0 ) and Wj (f1 , f0 ), have
a lower bound 0 if j is even, and have a lower bound
−j(j − 1)j−1 /ej−1 − (j − 1)j if j is odd.

Theorem 3. For any measurable function ϕ, if the integer
j ≥ 1 is odd, we have
∗
Wϕ,j (f1 , f0 ) ≤ Wj (f1 , f0 ) + Cj ,

(12)

∗
where Cj is deﬁned by equation (11).

Proof: Fix the odd integer j ≥ 1, by taking derivatives, it
is easy to see that H(t) = (− log t)j is convex on 0 < t ≤ 1
or t ≥ ej−1 but is concave when 1 ≤ t ≤ ej−1 . Let t0 = ej−1 ,
then H(t) ≤ H(t0 ) + H ′ (t0 )(t − t0 ) = −Cj t + dj for 1 ≤ t ≤
t0 , where Cj > 0 is deﬁned in (10) and dj = (j − 1)j−1 ≥ 0.
Now the line y = −Cj t + dj intersects the curve y = H(t) =
(− log t)j at two points: one is t = t0 = ej−1 ≥ 1 and the
other is in the interval (0, 1] and denoted by t∗ ≤ 1. Therefore,
we can construct a convex function as follows:

 H(t) = (− log t)j , if 0 < t ≤ t∗ (≤ 1);

˜
−Cj t + dj ,
if t∗ ≤ t < t0 = ej−1 ;
H(t) =


H(t) = (− log t)j , if t ≥ t0 (≥ 1).
˜
Clearly, by our construction, the convex function H(t) is
j
continuous and dominates H(t) = (− log t) .
∗
˜
Next, we claim that 0 ≤ H(t) − H(t) ≤ Cj for all t > 0,
∗
where Cj is deﬁned through (11). In other words, the dif˜
ference between H(t) and H(t) = (− log t)j is insigniﬁcant.
∗
To prove this claim, ﬁrst note that Cj = H(t∗ ) ≥ 0 and it
˜
sufﬁces to prove the claim when t∗ ≤ t < t0 , i.e., when H(t)
is decreasing as it is a linear function with negative slope. The
proof needs to consider two scenarios, depending on whether
t ≤ 1 or ≥ 1. If t∗ ≤ t ≤ 1, then the claim clearly holds
∗
˜

since H(t) ≤ H(t∗ ) = Cj and H(t) ≥ 0. On the other hand,
