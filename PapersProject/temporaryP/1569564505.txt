Symmetrical Multilevel Diversity Coding with an
All-Access Encoder

on a generalization of Han’s subset inequality, which was
established by carefully combining Han’s subset inequality
with several highly technical results on the analysis of a
sequence of linear programs.
In this paper, we consider a generalization of SMDC for
which, in addition to the randomly accessible encoders, there
is also an all-access encoder. More speciﬁcally, in this new
setting, a total of L + 1 independent discrete memoryless
sources (S0 , S1 , . . . , SL ) are to be encoded by a total of L + 1
encoders. While encoders 1 to L are randomly accessible
encoders as before, encoder 0 is assumed to be an all-access
encoder. Mathematically, if we denote by U ⊆ ΩL the set
of randomly accessible encoders whose outputs are actually
available at the decoder, then the set of accessible encoders
at the decoder is {0} ∪ U . As before, the realization of U
is unknown a priori at the encoders. However, the sources
(S0 , S1 , . . . , Sα ) need to be nearly perfectly reconstructed
whenever |U | ≥ α.
The main result of the paper is that superposition coding
remains optimal in terms of achieving the entire admissible
rate region of SMDC even with the addition of an allaccess encoder. Key to our proof is to identify the supporting
hyperplanes that deﬁne the boundary of the admissible rate
region and then builds on the result of Yeung and Zhang
on the generalization of Han’s subset inequality. As a special
case, the (R0 , Rs ) admissible rate region, which captures all
possible tradeoffs between the encoding rate R0 of the allaccess encoder and the sum encoding rate Rs of the randomly
accessible encoders, is explicitly characterized. To provide an
explicit proof of the optimality of superposition coding, a new
sliding-window subset entropy inequality is introduced and is
shown to directly imply the classical subset entropy inequality
of Han.

Abstract—Symmetrical Multilevel Diversity Coding (SMDC) is
a network compression problem introduced by Roche (1992) and
Yeung (1995). This paper considers a generalization of SMDC
for which, in addition to the randomly accessible encoders, there
is also an all-access encoder. It is shown that a simple separate
coding strategy known as superposition coding is optimal in terms
of achieving the entire admissible rate region of the problem. Key
to our proof is to identify the supporting hyperplanes that deﬁne
the boundary of the admissible rate region and then builds on the
result of Yeung and Zhang on a generalization of Han’s subset
inequality.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Symmetrical Multilevel Diversity Coding (SMDC) is a
network compression problem introduced by Roche [1] and
Yeung [2]. In this setting, there are a total of L independent discrete memoryless sources (S1 , . . . , SL ), where the
importance of the source Sl is assumed to decrease with the
subscript l. The sources are to be encoded by a total of L
randomly accessible encoders. The goal of encoding is to
ensure that the number of sources that can be nearly perfectly
reconstructed grows with the number of accessible encoders.
More speciﬁcally, denote by U ⊆ ΩL := {1, . . . , L} the set
of accessible encoders. The realization of U is unknown a
priori at the encoders. However, the sources (S1 , . . . , Sα ) need
to be nearly perfectly reconstructed whenever |U | ≥ α. The
word “symmetrical” here refers to the fact that the sources
that need to be nearly perfectly reconstructed depend on the
set of accessible encoders only via its cardinality. The rate
allocations at different encoders, however, can be different and
are not necessarily symmetrical.
A natural strategy for SMDC is to encode the sources
separately at each of the encoders (no coding across different
sources) known as superposition coding [2]. To show that
the natural superposition coding strategy is also optimal,
however, turned out to be rather nontrivial. The optimality of
superposition coding in terms of achieving the minimum sum
rate was established by Roche, Yeung, and Hau [3]. The proof
used a carefully constructed induction argument, for which
the classical subset entropy inequality of Han [4, Ch. 17.6]
played a key role. Later, the optimality of superposition coding
in terms of achieving the entire admission rate region was
established by Yeung and Zhang [5]. Their proof was based

A. Problem Statement
As illustrated in Figure 1, the problem of SMDC with an
all-access encoder consists of:
• a total of L + 1 independent discrete memoryless sources
{Sα [t]}∞ , where α = 0, 1, . . . , L and t is the time
t=1
index;
• a set of L + 1 encoders (encoders 0 to L);
• a decoder who has access to a subset {0} ∪ U of the
encoder outputs, where U ⊆ ΩL .

This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation
under Grant CCF-08-45848.

• First compress the source sequence Sα into a source
message W using a lossless source code. It is well known
[4, Ch. 5] that the rate of the source message W can
be made arbitrarily close to the entropy rate H(Sα ) for
sufﬁciently large block length n.
• Next, the source message W is encoded at encoders 0
to L using a maximum distance separable code [7]. It is
well known [1], [2] that the source message W can be
perfectly recovered at the decoder whenever

for all α = 1, . . . , L. Here, the second equality is due to the
fact that cα is optimal so U∈Ω(α) cα (U ) = fα . Substituting

H(X1 ) give the inequality chain (16).

A proof of the proposition is provided in [6]. The proof uses
the fact that Rsup is a polyhedron with polyhedral cone being
the nonnegative orthant in RL+1 and hence can be completely
characterized by the supporting hyperplanes

We then complete the proof by showing that for any nonzero
(λ1 , . . . , λL ), the faces of Rsup are only determined by the
supporting hyperplanes with λ0 = fm for m = 1, . . . , L.

In [5], Proposition 3 was established via a delicate combination of Han’s subset inequality and several highly technical
results on the analysis of the linear program (9). In [6], we
provide a more structured proof which completely separates
the entropy argument from the analysis of the linear program
(9). The proof is based on a subset entropy inequality recently
established by Madiman and Tetali [8] and an analysis result
on the linear program (9) lifted from the original proof of
Yeung and Zhang [5].
The following corollaries will be directly used in the proof

IV. D ISCUSSIONS
Our proof of the optimality of superposition coding for the
entire admissible rate region relies on a characterization of
the superposition coding rate region which involves solving
a sequence of linear programs (9) for α = 1, . . . , L. For a
general nonnegative (λ1 , . . . , λL ) in RL , the optimal solution
of the linear program (9) cannot be written in closed-form
for α = 2, . . . , L − 1. For the symmetrical situation where
λ1 = · · · = λL , however, it is straightforward to verify that

A. An Explicit Characterization of the (R0 , Rs ) Admissible
Rate Region
First, let us use (23) to establish an explicit characterization
of all possible tradeoffs between the encoding rate R0 of
the all-access encoder and the sum encoding rate Rs of the
randomly accessible encoders, as captured by the (R0 , Rs )
admissible rate region of the problem.
Formally, the (R0 , Rs ) admissible rate region R is deﬁned
as

satisfying
(25)

for all m = 0, 1, . . . , L. We have the following explicit
characterization of the (R0 , Rs ) admissible rate region R .

which is precisely the classical subset entropy inequality
of Han. We thus conclude that Han’s subset inequality is
sufﬁcient to prove the optimality of superposition coding for
the (R0 , Rs ) admissible rate region.
Note, however, that when λ1 = λ2 = · · · = λL > 0, the
optimal solution to the linear program (9) is not unique for
α = 2, . . . , L − 1. Below we provide a different set of optimal
solutions to the linear program (9) for α = 2, . . . , L−1, based
on which we construct a new subset entropy inequality.

B. A Sliding-Window Subset Entropy Inequality

region R is determined by the supporting hyperplanes of the
admissible rate region R with λ0 = 1 and λ1 = · · · = λL =
m/L for m = 0, 1, . . . , L. Therefore, to prove the optimality
of superposition coding for the (R0 , Rs ) admissible rate region
R , one may only need to invoke the generalized Han’s subset

Just like the classical subset entropy inequality of Han, the

prove the optimality of superposition coding for the (R0 , Rs )

derived from the sliding-window subset entropy inequality via
a very simple permutation argument. The readers are referred
