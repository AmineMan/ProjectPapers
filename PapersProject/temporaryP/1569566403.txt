Bounds on the Minimum Energy-Per-Bit
for Bursty Trafﬁc in Diamond Networks

In this work we start studying the fundamental limits of
bursty communication in relay networks. We consider the
symmetric diamond network shown in Figure 1, and we follow
the bursty communication model from [4]. We assume that
B bits of data become available at the source at a random
arrival time νB , and must be communicated to the destination
with a maximum delay dB 1 . The arrival time νB of the data
at the source is assumed to be drawn uniformly at random
from {1, ..., AB }, independent of the data bits. Moreover, νB
is unknown to both relays and the destination, and unknown
to the source until time t = νB . Under a similar setting,
the asynchronous minimum energy-per-bit for point-to-point
channels was characterized in [4].

Abstract—When data trafﬁc in a wireless network is bursty,
small amounts of data sporadically become available for transmission, and the energy cost associated with synchronizing the
network nodes prior to each communication block is not negligible. Therefore, designing energy-efﬁcient communication schemes
for such asynchronous scenarios is of particular importance.
In this paper, we show that, for symmetric diamond networks,
by performing the tasks of synchronization and communication
separately, it is possible to achieve the minimum energy-per-bit
to within a factor that ranges from 2 in the synchronous case to
1 in the highly asynchronous regime.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Traditional wireless communication models assume that
transmitters and receivers are synchronized, in the sense that
the receiver knows when data transmission is about to start.
In applications such as Wi-Fi and cellular networks, where
large amounts of data are to be transmitted, this is justiﬁed
by the fact that the time and energy required for synchronization are negligible when compared to what is required for
data communication. However, in certain applications such as
wireless sensor networks, small amounts of time-sensitive data
are sporadically available for transmission, at times that are
unknown to the receivers. In such scenarios, the receiver is
constantly listening to the output of a noisy channel in an
attempt to identify a message. An extra amount of energy is
then spent at the transmitter to make sure that the message is
not missed and the noise is not mistaken for the message.
In the sporadic data model, this extra energy represents a
signiﬁcant part of the total energy spent and becomes a
relevant quantity. There is a large body of work treating
synchronization from a practical perspective with the goal
of minimizing overheads and synchronization errors [1, 2].
However, these studies lack a fundamental characterization of
the energy and bandwidth costs of synchronization.
Early work on the fundamental limits of asynchronous
communication involved characterizing the data rates that can
be achieved when the receiver does not know the beginning
of the communication block [3]. Later, in [4], a similar model
was considered, but the performance metric was instead the
energy (or, in general, the cost) per bit required for reliable
communication. In wireless sensor networks, sensors are often
battery-operated. Thus, in the case of short and sporadic
transmissions, i.e., bursty trafﬁc, when synchronization costs
may dominate the communication costs, the characterization
of the minimum energy-per-bit is very relevant.

Symmetric diamond network.

By considering the diamond network, the main question
we wish to address is “how should relays facilitate the communication between source and destination when they do not
know the beginning of the transmission block?”. The natural
approach is to consider a separation-based coding scheme, i.e.,
performing the tasks of synchronization and communication
separately. Thus, as soon as the message arrives (at time νB )
the source uses a synchronization signal in order to inform the
relays that the message is about to be transmitted. The relays
can then do the same, making the destination aware of the
beginning of the transmission block. If this synchronization
procedure succeeds, communication can then take place as if
we were in the synchronous setting.
Separation-based schemes are important due to their ease
of design and implementation. However, they are potentially
wasteful, since, in principle, relays do not need to know the
beginning of the transmission block precisely. In essence, we
would like to know whether the relays should be synchronized
and whether separation-based schemes perform well. We for1 We index the random arrival time ν and the delay constraint d by B since
we will consider an asymptotic regime in B, as described in Section II.

malize the notion of relay synchronization by saying that a
coding scheme synchronizes relay i if the signals received
by relay i during times 1, 2, ..., AB , AB + 1, ..., AB + dB ,
represented by YiAB +dB , reveal a signiﬁcant amount of information about νB ; i.e., if H(νB | YiAB +dB ) is small. We then
show that any scheme for the symmetric diamond network that
achieves a ﬁnite energy-per-bit must synchronize both relays.
The main idea of the proof is that, in any coding scheme
with small error probability, the relays must spend a signiﬁcant
amount of energy between times νB and νB + dB . Therefore,
each relay can construct a short list of “guesses” for the true
arrival time based on where most of its output energy is spent,
and that list contains νB with high probability, implying that
H(νB | YiAB +dB ) is small.
The fact that the relays need to be synchronized suggests
that there is a certain energy penalty associated with using
the relays in the asynchronous setting. This idea allows us
to derive a lower bound for the asynchronous minimum
energy-per-bit. This bound is then shown to be within a
constant fraction of the energy-per-bit achieved by a simple
separation-based scheme. This fraction is 1/2 in the worstcase, but it approaches 1 as (log AB )/B increases, implying
that separation-based schemes are nearly optimal in the highasynchronism regime.

code is comprised of

, which deﬁnes the source transmit signals

• relaying functions ρi,t : R

i’s transmit signal at time t given its received signals in
times 1, ..., t − 1, for t = 1, ..., AB + dB ;
• a sequential decoder (τ, m), which, at time t, decides to
ˆ
either decode the message (in which case it sets τ = t
and outputs a decoded message m) or to wait (in which
ˆ
case τ > t).
Notice that, outside the interval [νB : νB + dB ], the source is
not allowed to transmit. Thus, for relay i ∈ {1, 2} and time
t ∈ [νB : νB + dB ], Yi [t] = Zi [t].

II. P ROBLEM S ETUP
We consider the symmetric diamond network, shown in
Figure 1. We assume a discrete-time model where, at time
t, each transmitter node u ∈ {S, 1, 2} transmits a realvalued signal Xu [t], each relay i, for i ∈ {1, 2}, receives
√
Yi [t] = √ gXS [t] + Zi [t], and the destination D receives
YD [t] = h (X1 [t] + X2 [t]) + ZD [t], where Z1 [t], Z2 [t] and
ZD [t] are independent i.i.d. N (0, N0 ) noise terms.
Our bursty trafﬁc model follows the asynchronous communication model introduced in [4]. The source receives a B-bits
message m at some random time ν ∈ [1 : A], where, for a < b,
we deﬁne [a : b] ￿ {a, a + 1, ..., b}. The source then needs to
communicate this message to the destination with a delay of
at most d time-steps.
In order to formally deﬁne reliable communication, we
consider the asymptotic regime of B → ∞. Thus, we consider
a sequence of arrival distributions {νB }∞ , where νB is
B=1
uniform on [1 : AB ] and AB = 2βB , for B = 1, 2, ... and some
β > 0. Notice that, as B → ∞, B/AB → 0, thus capturing
the idea of short and sporadic messages. Once the B bits arrive
at the source at time νB , they must be communicated to the
destination within a delay dB . Notice that, in order for the
problem to be meaningful, dB should be small in comparison
to AB . Otherwise, it would be possible to devise a strategy
where the source only starts its trasmission at pre-deﬁned timesteps separated by dB time-steps, and the trafﬁc would not be
actually bursty. Thus, since AB is exponential in B, we will
require the delay dB to be subexponential in B.
An asynchronous code C for the symmetric diamond network is designed to communicate a speciﬁc number of bits B

III. M AIN R ESULT
Our main result is to ﬁnd upper and lower bounds on the
asynchronous minimum energy-per-bit for the symmetric diamond network. The achievability scheme for the upper bound
uses a separation-based code. The lower bound is obtained by
formalizing the notion of relay synchronization, and showing
that, for any sequence of coding schemes that achieve ﬁnite
energy-per-bit, both relays must be synchronized.

IV. ACHIEVABILITY WITH S EPARATION -BASED S CHEMES

To compute the energy used in the communication phase,
we notice that we can analyze the two hops separately, since
we are employing decode-and-forward. For the ﬁrst hop, the
energy-per-bit can be chosen arbitrarily close to the minimum
energy-per-bit for a point-to-point channel with channel gain
g, i.e., γ/g. In the second hop, we use beamforming to reduce
the energy-per-bit that is consumed. It can be seen that the
total energy-per-bit used by both relays together can be chosen
arbitrarily close to γ/(2h). We conclude that energy-per-bit

Our upper bound in Theorem 1 is achieved with a simple
separation-based scheme; i.e., a scheme where we perform
the tasks of synchronization and communication separately.
Synchronization will be achieved through pulses, and, for
communication, we will use a simple decode-and-forward
scheme. Notice that several relaying schemes that outperform
decode-and-forward are known [5]. However, decode-andforward is simpler to analyze and, as we will see, performs
nearly optimally.

The main ingredient that is necessary to prove our lower
bound on the minimum asynchronous energy-per-bit is the fact
that a relay can only be helpful in a coding scheme (from the
energy-per-bit point of view) if it is synchronized. In this work,
we will deﬁne synchronization as follows.

Proof: We construct a sequence of codes {Ck }∞ , where
k=1
Ck transmits Bk bits assuming arrival distribution νBk , for
any sequence {Bk }∞ , where Bk → ∞ as k → ∞. Our
k=1
scheme is based on having the source send a pulse as soon
as the message arrives. This pulse is detected by the relays,
which send another pulse to the destination, taking advantage
of beamforming. After relays and destination correctly detect
their pulses, the network is in the synchronous setting, and we
may employ decode-and-forward to communicate the Bk bits.
More precisely, upon receiving the message, at time νBk ,
the source will transmit a pulse of magnitude

Lemma 1. Suppose we have a sequence of asynchronous
codes {Ck }∞ for the symmetric diamond network that
k=1
achieves a ﬁnite energy-per-bit. Then, relay i ∈ {1, 2} can
(i)
create a list Λk ⊂ [1 : Ak ] based on its received signals that
contains νBk with vanishing error probability, and has a size
(i)
|Λk | that is subexponential in Bk .

Proof Sketch: Here, we describe the steps to prove that

relay i ∈ {1, 2} can create a list Λk with subexponential

The intuition behind the proof is simple. If a code Ck has
small error probability, then, in the block [νBk : νBk + dBk ],
at least one of the two relays should consume a signiﬁcant
amount of energy. Moreover, if the sequence of codes {Ck }∞
k=1
achieves a ﬁnite energy-per-bit, the relays should not be
spending too much energy outside of [νBk : νBk + dBk ]. Thus,
by only looking at the times when the relays consume the most
energy, one should be able to estimate the arrival time νBk .

If the relays correctly detect the pulse, they can transmit pulses
to the destination in the next time slot. Since they can use
beamforming to reduce the total energy required, at time νBk +

which the probability that νBk ∈ Λk ￿ Λk ∪Λk tends to 0 as

k → ∞. The main idea of the argument is as follows. Fix some
α > 0, and notice that, if one of the relays uses a total energy
of at least αBk in the “correct window”, i.e., [νBk : νBk +dBk ],
then with high probability νBk will be included in Λk . This
is the case since, from Markov’s inequality, the probability
that the relays consume a total energy of at most E [ECk ] Bk
is at least 1 − 1/Bk , and, in this case, there cannot be more
than dBk E [ECk ] /α windows [t : t + dBk ] where one of the
relays uses energy at least αBk . Therefore, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd

as a corollary of Lemma 1, we have shown the following.

where ECk1 2 [νBk : νBk + dBk ] is the energy spent by the
relays in the window [νBk : νBk + dBk ]. By contradiction, we
suppose that no such α exists, which means that for any ﬁxed
α, the limit inferior in (1) equals some δ(α) > 0. But then we
notice that, since the error probability of our original sequence
of codes {Ck }∞ tends to 0 as k → ∞, for large k, the error
k=1
probability can be arbitrarily smaller than δ(α). Intuitively,
(r ,r )
this means that, conditioned on the event ECk1 2 [νBk : νBk +
dBk ] < 2αBk , the probability of error is still going to 0,
as k → ∞. Moreover, this should hold for any small α >
0. To obtain a contradiction, we show that the sequence of
codes {Ck }∞ can be used to construct another sequence of

the synchronous setting (i.e., the two-input one-output channel
from Figure 2), where the transmitters (which correspond to

and transmit Bk − o(Bk ) bits with vanishing error probability.
This implies that the transmitters spend a total energy-perh

( gX + Z1,1 , gX + Z1,2 ) is a vector, and Z1,1 , Z1,2 and
Z2 are independent i.i.d. N (0, N0 ) noise terms. To use code
Ck on this channel in the synchronous setting, we have the
source choose an arrival time νBk uniformly at random from
[1 : 2βBk ] and transmit the message as if we were in the
asynchronous setting. Since it has two antennas, destination
D1 can then simulate what the relays would have received
and transmitted and what the destination would have received

bit of at most 2α + o(1), where α can be chosen arbitrarily
small. But this is clearly a contradiction, since the two-input
one-output channel considered has a positive (synchronous)
minimum energy-per-bit.
Finally, from Deﬁnition 1, E [ECk ] is linear in Bk and dBk
(i)
is subexponential in Bk . Thus |Λk | = dBk E [ECk ] /α must
be subexponential in Bk .
To see that Lemma 1 implies that both relays must be
synchronized, consider a sequence of codes {Ck }∞ that

achieves a ﬁnite energy-per-bit, and assume that relay i creates

VI. C ONCLUDING R EMARKS
In this work, we found asymptotically tight bounds for
the asynchronous minimum energy-per-bit of the symmetric
diamond network. In [6], we extend these results to the
asymmetric case. This is done by showing that any relay that
is used (i.e., does not stay silent) must be synchronized, which
yields bounds similar to those in Theorem 1.
