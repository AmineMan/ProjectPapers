Abstract—We consider a real-time streaming system where
messages are created sequentially at the source, and are encoded
for transmission over a packet erasure channel. Each message
must subsequently be decoded at the receiver within a given delay
from its creation time. We consider code design and maximum
message rates when all messages must be decodable by their
respective deadlines under a speciﬁed set of erasure patterns
(erasure model). Speciﬁcally, we provide a code construction that
achieves the optimal rate for an asymptotic number of messages,
under erasure models containing a limited number of erasures
per coding window, per sliding window, and containing erasure
bursts of a limited length.

correct erasure bursts of a given length. Tekin et al. [3] considered erasure correction coding for a non-real-time streaming
system where all messages are initially present at the encoder.
We begin with a formal deﬁnition of the problem in
Section II, and proceed to describe the construction of our
intrasession code in Section III. We then demonstrate the
optimality of this code under each erasure model in the
subsequent sections. Proofs of some theorems can be found
in Appendix B; complete proofs are deferred to the extended
paper [4].

II. P ROBLEM D EFINITION

We consider packet erasure correction coding for a real-time
streaming system where messages are created sequentially at
the source, and each message must be decoded at the receiver
within a given delay from its creation time. The coding scheme
is designed to ensure recovery of messages under a given set
of possible erasure patterns (erasure model).
In particular, we consider three erasure models: the ﬁrst
model considers a limited number of erasures in each coding
window, the second considers a limited number of erasures in
each sliding window, while the third considers erasure bursts
of a limited length. For each erasure model, the objective is to
ﬁnd an optimal code that achieves the maximum message size
among all codes that allow all messages to be decoded by their
respective deadlines under all admissible erasure patterns.
We present an explicit intrasession code construction which
speciﬁes an allocation of each packet’s capacity among the
different messages; coding occurs within each message but
not across messages. Intrasession coding is attractive due to
its relative simplicity, but it is not known in general when
intrasession coding sufﬁces or when intersession coding is
needed. We show that for an asymptotic number of messages,
our code construction achieves the optimal rate among all
codes (intrasession or intersession) for the ﬁrst and second
erasure models with any given number of erasures per window,
and for the third erasure model with sufﬁciently short or long
erasure bursts.
In related work, Martinian et al. [1], [2] provided constructions of streaming codes that minimize the delay required to

Consider a discrete-time data streaming system comprising
a source and a receiver, with a directed link of normalized
unit capacity from the source to the receiver. The source
creates independent messages of uniform size s > 0 at regular
intervals of c ∈ Z+ time steps, and is allowed to transmit at
most a unit amount of coded data over the link at each time
step. The receiver attempts to decode each message within
d ∈ Z+ time steps of its creation.
More precisely, each message k ∈ Z+ is created at time step
(k − 1)c + 1, and is to be decoded by time step (k − 1)c + d.
The coded data transmitted at each time step t ∈ Z+ must be
a function of messages created at time step t or earlier. Let
coding window Wk be the interval of d time steps between
the creation time and the decoding deadline of message k, i.e.,
Wk

{(k − 1)c + 1, . . . , (k − 1)c + d}.

We shall assume that d > c so as to avoid the degenerate case
of nonoverlapping coding windows for which it is sufﬁcient
to code individual messages separately.
Consider the ﬁrst n messages {1, . . . , n}, and the union of
their (overlapping) coding windows Tn , given by
Tn

W1 ∪ · · · ∪ Wn = {1, . . . , (n − 1)c + d}.

An erasure pattern E ⊆ Tn speciﬁes the set of erased or lost
data transmissions over the link. More precisely, if t ∈ E, then
none of the data transmitted at time step t is received by the
receiver; if t ∈ Tn \E, then all of the data transmitted at time
step t is received by the receiver at time step t. An erasure
model essentially describes a distribution of erasure patterns.
For a given pair of positive integers a and b, we deﬁne
the offset quotient qa,b and remainder ra,b to be the unique

have qd,c + 1 = 3 active messages at each time step. In (b), because d is not
a multiple of c, we have either qd,c = 2 or qd,c + 1 = 3 active messages at
each time step.

The qd,c + 1 messages of At are therefore encoded at time

The qd,c messages of At are therefore encoded at time step t,

with each message allocated qd,c amount of link capacity.
Note that when d is a multiple of c, we have rt,c ≤ rd,c = c
for any t, which implies that qd,c + 1 messages are encoded
at every time step.
In our subsequent performance analysis of this code, we
make repeated use of two key code properties; these are
presented as technical lemmas in Appendix A.

III. C ODE C ONSTRUCTION
We present an intrasession code which codes only within
each message and not across different messages. We begin
by specifying the amount of link capacity allocated for the
encoding of each message at each time step. An appropriate
code (e.g., random linear coding, MDS code) is then applied to
the allocation so that each message can be decoded whenever
the total amount of received data that encodes that message is
at least the message size s.
The allocation of link capacity follows a simple rule: the
link capacity at each time step is divided evenly among all
active messages. We say that message k is active at time step t
if and only if t falls within its coding window, i.e., t ∈ Wk .
Fig. 1 shows how much link capacity at each time step is
allocated to each message, for two instances of (c, d).
For a given choice of c and d, the messages that are encoded
at a given time step t ∈ Z+ can be stated explicitly as follows:
First, we deﬁne At to be the set of active messages at time
step t, i.e.,

that have a limited number of erasures per coding window.

We observe that over a ﬁnite time horizon (i.e., when the
number of messages n is ﬁnite), intrasession coding can be
suboptimal. For example, given (n, c, d, z) = (3, 1, 3, 1), the
optimal intrasession code (which can be found by solving a
linear program) achieves a message size of 6 , which is strictly
7
CW
smaller than the maximum achievable message size sn of 1
obtained by intersession coding, e.g., transmitting messages
(1, 2, 1⊕2, 3, 3) at time steps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), respectively.
However, it turns out that the intrasession code constructed
in Section III is asymptotically optimal; the gap between the
CW
maximum achievable message size sn and the message size
achieved by the code vanishes as the number of messages n
goes to inﬁnity:

SW
CW
We note that since En ⊆ En , we therefore have
CW
sn ≥ sn . For the special case of c = 1, each sliding window is also a coding window, and so this sliding window
erasure model reduces to the coding window erasure model
SW
CW
of Section IV, i.e., En = En . Over a ﬁnite time horizon,
intrasession coding can also be suboptimal for this erasure
model; the illustrating example from Section IV applies here
as well.
Surprisingly, the constructed intrasession code also turns
out to be asymptotically optimal over all codes; the omission
SW
CW
of erasure patterns in En compared to En has not led
to an increase in the maximum achievable message size
(cf. Theorem 1):

Theorem 1. The code constructed in Section III is asymptotically optimal in the following sense: the code achieves a

Proving the above theorem requires a different approach
from that of Theorem 1. When d is a multiple of c, we need
only consider a cut-set bound corresponding to an obvious
“worst-case” erasure pattern in which exactly z erasures occur
in every sliding window, speciﬁcally, a periodic erasure pattern
with alternating intervals of z erasures and d − z nonerasures.
When d is not a multiple of c, we consider a “base” erasure
pattern E ′ chosen with the help of Lemma 2, and inductively
compute an upper bound for the conditional entropy

We prove the above theorem by considering a cut-set bound
corresponding to a speciﬁc “worst-case” erasure pattern in
which exactly z erasures occur in every coding window.
This erasure pattern is chosen with the help of Lemma 2;
speciﬁcally, the erased time steps are chosen to coincide with
the larger blocks allocated to each message in the constructed
code.

by using erasure patterns derived from the base, where Xt is
a random variable representing the coded data transmitted at
time step t, Mk is a random variable representing message k,
X[A] (Xt )t∈A , and M [A] (Mk )k∈A . The nonnegativity

of this expression leads us to a bound for sn that matches
the message size achieved by the constructed code in the limit
